<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>In attempting even a brief and imperfect outline
of the history of Egyptian queens the author
has undertaken no easy task and craves indulgence
for its modest fulfillment. The aim
has been merely to put the little that is known
in a readable and popular form, to gather from
many sources the fragments that remain, partly
historic, partly legendary, of a dead past. To
present—however imperfectly—sketches of the
women who once lived and breathed as Queens
of Egypt, which has been more ably and completely
done—as the period was less remote and
the sources of information fuller, for their royal
sisters of other lands.</p>

<p>A short article published some years ago in
Lippincott’s Magazine may be said to be the nucleus
of the present volume, the writer’s interest
in the subject having been awakened by the
study necessary to its preparation.</p>

<p>We enter a house through the portico or vestibule.
We form acquaintances on somewhat
the same principle. We begin perhaps with the
weather, we exchange comments on trifles, we
pass through an introductory stage of intercourse
before we reach the real heart of the man
or woman who, in time, becomes our dearest
friend. Skip the introduction if you will, busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
reader, but metaphorically it forms the portico
or vestibule of the Egyptian House.</p>

<p>From the darkness which envelopes the centuries
modern research has brought to light
much that was unknown or forgotten. With almost
the creative touch it has made the dry
bones to live again and link by link drawn out
the long chain of the years. What was once a
mere roll of names with a wide hiatus here and
there has grown to be a record of the words and
deeds of men of like passions with ourselves.
We feel once more in touch with the past, as it is
the aim of the highest altruism to beat responsive
to the heart of the present and the by-gone
faces look forth by the side of modern man and
claim the universal brotherhood.</p>

<p>Well may we marvel at the faith, the patience,
the ingenuity which has unraveled so much of
the tangled skein in “The Story of the Nations.”
Like Cuvier, from a single bone elaborating
a whole animal, the Egyptologist has patiently
evolved from shreds of parchment, from
fragments of pottery, from broken plinth and
capital a more or less complete whole. He has
woven a tapestry from which some of the figures
start forth with a lifelike vigor.</p>

<p>Few countries claim such antiquity as Egypt
and of none were the estimated dates more
widely apart. Sometimes involving periods of
hundreds and thousands of years. An accumulation
of difficulties meets the student as it does
the explorer. A cycle of time, beside which
modern life seems like a single breath. A
language, at first indecipherable, and even now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
imperfectly read. The hasty guesses of scholars
anxious to prove some point or be in the
vanguard of discovery; broken monuments,
rifled tombs, and inscriptions, mutilated, erased
and altered by the monarchs of succeeding generations.
Among all these difficulties lies the
way. But with patience and care we are rewarded
and with “imagination for a servant,”
not a master, one “arrives,” as the French say
(at least in a measure), at last.</p>

<p>The list of authorities consulted by the author
would be too long to enumerate, but among
them may be mentioned Rawlinson, Wilkinson,
Maspero, Erman, Ebers and later Edwards,
Sayce, Petrie and Mahaffy, whose interest is so
absorbing and the researches of some of whom
are of such recent date. To these may be added
the study of all available pictures and photographs,
and the experiences of late travel and
travellers.</p>

<h1>Predecessors of Cleopatra.</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_1">CHAPTER FIRST.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BLACK LAND.</span></h2>

<p>Kem, “the Black Land,” in hieroglyphic, or
Kemi, in the later and more familiar demotic,
was so called from its dark and fruitful soil, a
loam, which turned up freshly, after a recent inundation
of the Nile, has, as one traveller describes
it, “a brown and velvety lustre.”</p>

<p>Through it winds and flows the great river of
which Homer speaks as “Egypt’s Heaven descended
stream” and that more than any other
has set its stamp upon the country and its inhabitants.
So potent for weal or woe is it that
one scarce wonders it was worshipped as a
deity, and the Arabs call it “El Bahari,” the sea.
It is difficult to find the word travel in their
language, with the Egyptian it is always up and
down stream. From the river he drew the fish
which formed part of his daily food, its fructifying
waters, spreading over the land, called forth
abundant harvests, and from the mud on its
banks he built the hut in which he lived, or manufactured
the bricks for the construction of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
tomb or other more ambitious edifice. The
rushes that grew beside it furnished his writing
material, and its muddy or turbid water, as a
beverage, had for him the charm of a crystal rill.</p>

<p>Leigh Hunt says of the Nile:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“It flows through old hushed Egypt and its sands</div>
<div class="verse">Like some grave mighty thought threading a dream;</div>
<div class="verse">And times and things as in that vision seem</div>
<div class="verse">Keeping along it their eternal stands.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Nile has been said to be less like a river
than a sinuous lake with islands and sand-bars
interspersed.</p>

<p>The sacred name of the Nile was “Hapi, the
Concealed.” The early Egyptians believed that
its source was in fountains, bottomless and far
away, and the tears of the goddess Isis caused its
ebb and flow. The explorations of comparatively
modern travellers have solved the mystery of its
being, and to-day we know that it springs from
great lakes which their discoverers named respectively,
Victoria and Albert Nyanza.</p>

<p>Of the three great rivers, the Nile, the Mississippi,
and the Amazon, the first is the longest,
the second has the largest number of ramifications,
and the third the greatest volume of water.</p>

<p>A Nilometer, a pillar standing in a pit, chronicles
the rise of the tide, and great festivities attended
the opening of the canals which were
dug in all directions to carry its beneficent
stream. A human victim was sacrificed to appease
the river god. A young girl was each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
year dedicated to this purpose. Bound to a
stake, adorned with flowers, and hailed as
“Aruseh, the bride of the Nile,” she stood and
watched the on-coming flood which was to shut
out for her the light of day. Perhaps it was in
the terror with which the bounding pulses of
youth must ever regard the great Destroyer.
Perhaps with the heroic spirit of a martyr she
awaited her fate, glorying in it and giving herself
up a willing sacrifice, as the Hindoo woman
is said occasionally to have done in the Suttee,
when she cast herself on the funeral pile of her
husband.</p>

<p>It was a Mohammedan general who put an
end to this annual tragedy and refused to permit
the usual offering. The river delayed its
rising, and the murmurs of the people waxed
loud against him. In this dilemma he appealed
to the Kadlif Omar, he who destroyed the Alexandria
library, saying that if it agreed with the
Koran it was useless to preserve it, and if it differed
it was pernicious. But in this matter he
showed himself larger-minded. He obligingly
wrote a letter which was cast into the water and
ran thus: A. D. 640, “From Abd Allah Omar,
Prince of the Faithful, to the Nile of Egypt. If
thou flow of thine own accord, flow not, but if it
be Allah, the One, the Mighty, who causeth thee
to flow, then we implore Him to make thee
flow.”</p>

<p>The prayer was successful and the inundation
began. Henceforth a mud pillar, originally no
doubt in human form, and still called “the Bride
of the Nile,” was substituted for a trembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
maiden, and melted away before the encroaching
stream. At the inundation the land looks
like a marsh, the towns, etc., being just above the
level of the water, and even now the crier announces
the rise of the current.</p>

<p>The juncture of the White and Blue Nile
shows the difference in the tint of the water for
some time after. The Nile has no tides. The
dews are heavy in Lower Egypt and the nights
cool and refreshing, while the temperature is, as
a rule, most agreeable. From the low, long,
level shore and with a coast line much the same
as three thousand years ago, we follow the river
through a fertile valley, which in time narrows
between mountains and table-lands of sand. At
the cataracts the stream surges and swells round
little rocky islands and the rapids cause navigation
to be difficult if not dangerous.</p>

<p>The Delta, so called from its resemblance to
the Greek letter, is a level plain, highly cultivated,
varied by lofty dark brown, ancient
mounds, on which villages are often built, surrounded
by palm trees. The Greeks and Romans
divided Egypt into the Delta, or Lower
Egypt, and the Thebaid or Upper. The rocks are
generally of limestone, till one reaches Thebes,
and then they are of sandstone, while at the first
Cataract red granite bursts through the sandstone.
The granite is yellowish or reddish, with
no vegetation on the rocks. The drifts of yellow
sand are everywhere. In some parts the mountains
are three hundred feet high, and at Thebes
they rise to four times that height. On the eastern
side they are close to the water, while on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
western they are further from the edge. What
is called the Fayum is a fertile tract in the hollow
of the desert, while at the furthest extremity
is a lake of brackish water.</p>

<p>Upper Egypt is bounded by mountains,
through which the river has cut its way, their
height overshadowing it, but not rising into
sharp peaks. It is narrow and cultivated. From
the mouth of the Nile to the first cataract is six
hundred miles of fertile valley, and it is said
that the scenery of the first cataract resembles
nothing but that of the second.</p>

<p>The beauty of Egypt is in its coloring. The
small proportion of green is compensated for by
its intensity. Over the velvet soil hangs a sky of
turquoise blue, the sand sparkles like precious
stones and the clear air is luminous. “The land
where it is always afternoon” might almost be
named the golden land. The traveller with the
poetic or enthusiastic temperament revels in the
delicate variety of its hues. He sees the sun
turning the sands to gold, the river reflecting the
sky, the blue lotus blossoms and the reeds, the
picturesque buffaloes standing in the water with
sleepy blue eyes and the vivid green of wheat
fields. Another describes the rusty gold of the
Libyan rocks, the paler hue of the driven sand
slopes, the warm mauve of the nearer Pyramid,
which from a distance is a tender rose, like the
bloom of an apricot, in delicate tone against the
sky. Low on the horizon, soft and pearly tints,
blue and luminous at the zenith, while opalescent
shadows, pale blue and violet and greenish grey,
nestle in the hollows of the rocks and curves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the sand drifts. Lakelike plains, with palm
groves and corn flats, relieve the glowing distance.
Even in the moonlight one seems to see
the color.</p>

<p>From the top of the Pyramids the valley of
the Nile looks like a carpet of rich green, the
groves of palm trees like figures woven in deeper
tints. Another speaks of the palms as sculptured
in jasper and malachite against the rosy evening
sky.</p>

<p>A sense of rest and tranquillity pervades the
mind.</p>

<div class="verse">Far, far away did seem to mourn and rave.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Even the conscience slumbers. But the prosaic
traveller hurries through all with unseeing eyes.
Like the tourist who visited Cologne and was too
sleepy to get up and look at the Cathedral, he
gapes at the Pyramids, viewing them perhaps as
“warts on the face of creation,” and sees no
glory in the heavens, no beauty in the earth, the
story of the ages has no charm for him.</p>

<p>Long before “Once upon a time,” if such a
period can be conceived of, the great monuments
were raised, the colossal temples were built,
which have been the wonder of all succeeding
centuries, and yet still back of and beyond that,
stretching away to the confines of Eternity, we
picture to ourselves the land as it then was,
without these marvels of Art, when Nature ruled
supreme. Then as now the plains stretched out,
the yellow cliffs rose against the azure sky, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
desert spread afar, the purple cloud of the simoom
hovered over it. The sun sank in splendor
of violet, rose and gold, the torn and ragged
sides of the mountains poured down their torrents
of shining sand, the fissures burning with
a crimson lustre. The splendor passed and ashy
paleness followed; then a second paler but intense
yellow hue, ere the stars shone out. And
ever the Nile calm and unruffled swept on with
its eternal flow, while the air breathed balm.
Sometimes the waters gained, sometimes the
sand. The byblos or papyrus, now almost extinct,
abounded; along the waters edge forests
and reeds, later destroyed, were plentiful, and
wild bear, hippopotami and crocodiles whose ancient
haunts know them no more, roved freely.
The lakes abounded with fish, pelicans and ducks
lived on the shores, and turtle doves brooded on
the palm trees. The language of Egypt has
been changed once, the religion twice, but the
natural conditions remain steadfast.</p>

<p>Before Menes, the first king of whom any distinct
record has yet been recovered, man, civilized
man, possessed the earth. In tracing the
course of Egyptian history we never, as with
many other nations, seem to reach primeval humanity.
Like Minerva, springing ready armed
from the brain of Jupiter, the earliest Egyptian
known is in a measure civilized. The wild savage,
who develops into the more perfect man, exists
in theory, but we cannot lay our hand upon
him. Some authorities, as Professor Petrie, attribute
the beginning of Egyptian civilization, as
the Greeks found it, to Mesopotamian influences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and think the conquering race came over the Red
Sea and the conquered were of the same general
type as the Libyans of North Africa. But none
of these stories have yet been proved beyond the
possibility of differing opinion by other students.
Strabo said “The Egyptians lived from the first
under a regular form of government, they were
a people of civilized manners and settled a well-known
country.”</p>

<p>Claiming to be the most ancient of peoples the
old story tells how the Egyptians yet yielded
their pretensions to the Phrygians. The king
caused a shepherd to bring up two children,
nursed by a goat, and to observe what word they
first spoke. Running towards him they cried
“Beccos,” the Phrygian for bread, which decided
the question, but the wise mother goat perhaps
considered they were but imitating her “ba-a!”</p>

<p>The early Egyptian believed that Osiris and
Isis, brother and sister, as also husband and
wife, were the children of Seb (Saturn), and
Nepthys was the sister of Isis. The two were
called “the incubators,” who spread their wings
over the mummy to impart new life, Isis, represented
as a female figure, wearing on her head
the pshent or crown of Upper and Lower Egypt,
was the earth, the receptive one, was regarded
as the mother of all and held somewhat the position
to the Egyptians that Juno did to the
Greeks. The Egyptians also believed that the
heavens were upheld by four pillars and that
the stars were lamps lighted therein at night.
Osiris and Isis stood for the Nile and Egypt, and
Osiris was the sun’s power, the winter solstice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the birth of Horus the summer solstice, the inundations
of the Nile the autumnal Equinox.
His gods and goddesses were innumerable, their
images existing for him in the shape of various
animals and birds, and, among royalties, the ancestors
were deified.</p>

<p>We of to-day thrust from us the thought of
death, and live as much as may be in the present.
Not so the Egyptian, it pervaded his daily life
and it shared in his feasts and festivals. It rang
in his laughter, “Let us eat and drink for to-morrow
we die!” and his favorite occupation
was the building of his tomb.</p>

<p>No other nation possesses such a variety of
monuments, says one writer. Their stone quarries
were inexhaustible, their facilities for transportation
on the great river unlimited, and the
sand and the climate combined to preserve what
the hand of man erected. Kings pressed their
signets on the mountains that the generations to
come might know of them and their power.</p>

<p>The sun and soil of Egypt, we are told, demands
one breed of men and will no other. The
children of aliens die, and the special race characteristics
remain to the present day. The Fellah
woman, in the picture often seen, crouching
beside the statue of an ancient king, has the
same contour of face, the same high cheek bones
and nose, and the same immutable expression.
As the life rule of Egypt’s great river changes
not, year after year repeating the same history,
so the race shows the same characteristics, century
after century. She shares with China her
changelessness. Like Japan, she has her types<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of face, long, oval, slender, with heavy lidded
eyes, and nose characteristically depressed at the
tip, with sensitive open nostrils, the under lip
slightly projecting, the chin short and square,
with a slim square shouldered figure. Or a
lower, squatter type, belonging to the plebeian,
forehead low, nose depressed and short, face
prognathous and sensual-looking, the chin heavy,
the jaw large, the lips thick and projecting. Both
exist on the earliest monuments and to our own
time. One writer thinks that the mummies differ
from the Arabs of the present day in having
a better balance of the intellectual and moral
faculties. It is also said that in men the countenance
is narrower than in women. The forehead
small and retreating, with a long large black and
well-shaped eye, a long nose, with a slight
bridge, cheek bones a little prominent, an expressive
mouth, with full lips, and white regular
teeth, and a small round chin. The complexion
of men a dark brown, that of women olive to a
pink flesh color. The women and girls are slender,
with small straight brows and close lashes
on each lid, which gives an animated expression
to their almond-shaped eyes, the use of kohl
(sometimes said to be sanitary in its effects) enhancing
this. The forehead is receding, cheekbones
high, the bridge of the nose low, the
mouth wide and thick-lipped. The peasantry
are darker than the townspeople and the color
deepens from pale brown to bronze as you go
south.</p>

<p>Co-existent with, prior even, perhaps, to the
pyramids is the great Sphinx. Maspero believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
that it dated before the time of Menes. Battered,
mutilated, time worn, yet rearing itself
nobly still with its majestic face in its tranquil
grandeur, turned towards the East. Towering
sixty feet above one of the sand dunes, with a
background of yellow sand or sapphire sky, or
whitening in the moonlight against the starlit
indigo heavens rises this colossal head and shoulders.
“Mutilated though it is,” says one traveller,
“the changeless serenity, the eternal repose
of the noble countenance impresses and awes all
beholders.” The typical sphinx, a male or female
head, with an animal’s body, in the Greek
“the strangler,” signifies intelligence or force. It
was a favorite form in architecture and sometimes
the face was a portrait of an existing king
or queen. The great Sphinx is said, from an inscription
at Edfu, to represent one of the personifications
of the god Horus. It was designated
as Horem Khou, “Horus on the Horizon,”
and bore the shape of a human-headed lion to
vanquish Typhon (Set) principle of evil, and
turning East awaited the resurrection of his
father Osiris. As Horus was supposed to have
reigned over Egypt, kings took the name Horus,
or “Golden Hawk.”</p>

<p>A picture of the Sphinx, by Elihu Vedder, is
very impressive. The great head looms skyward,
the desert spreads around, the silence of Eternity
broods over all. A crouching figure, old and
tattered, kneels before it and lays his ear to the
silent lips, as if to learn their hidden secrets.</p>

<p>The land is rich in fruits and vegetables, but
it has comparatively few trees, and no great variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of flowers. Palms, sycamores, figs, and
accasias are among the most frequent of the former.
Vegetables are peas, lentils, leeks, onions,
garlic, celery, cucumbers, carrots, turnips, tomatoes,
egg-fruit, peppers, etc. Fruits are melons,
of which the flesh is often a rich golden color,
grapes, dates, almonds, figs, pomegranates, apricots,
peaches, etc. The lotus, now comparatively
rare, might once have been called the national,
as it certainly was the favorite flower. It was
used at feasts and for decorations, and its buds,
blossoms and leaves were continually reproduced
in architectural designs. It was chiefly because
the water lily bud opened its petals at sunrise
and closed them at sunset that the ancients held
it sacred to the sun. Pliny says: “It is reported
that in the Euphrates the flower of the lotus
plunges into the water at night, remaining there
until midnight, and to such a depth that it cannot
be reached with the hand. After midnight
it begins gradually to rise, and as the sun rises
above the horizon the flower also rises above the
water, expands and raises itself some distance
above the element in which it grows.” “And it
was also through this peculiarity,” says another
writer, “that Hankerville proved that the Egyptians
considered the lily an emblem of the world
as it rose from the waters of the deep.”</p>

<p>Other flowers include the rose, jassamine, narcissus,
lily, convolvulus, violet, chrysanthemum,
geranium, dahlia, basil, etc.</p>

<p>The horse was not an early inhabitant—there
were camels, elephants, and cattle of special
breeds, doves and other birds and many varieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of fish. A number of animals were tamed in
Egypt and some of them would seem to us a
singular collection of pets, lions, leopards, monkeys,
gazelles and even crocodiles, and, above all,
cats were household pets, as were the last two
among the sacred animals.</p>

<p>Everywhere possible at the present day excavation
is going on. Seventy-five centimes a day
was at one time the rate for the diggers and fifty
for the children who carried away the baskets of
rubbish, the food consisting of bread, water, a
few dates, cucumbers or onions, and, rarely if
ever, any meat.</p>

<p>“The Nile shore,” says Bayard Taylor, “shows
either palm groves, fields of cane or doura,
young wheat, or patches of bare sand blown
from the desert. The villages have mud walls
and the tombs of Moslem saints looking like
white ovens. The Arabian and Libyan mountains
sweep into the foreground, the yellow cliffs
overhang and recede into a violet haze at the
horizon, while the blue evening shadows lie on
rose-hued mountain walls.”</p>

<p>Life in the East moves more slowly, even in
modern times, than in the strenuous West. One
traveller playfully remarks that one can perceive
in the face after a Nile voyage something
of the patience and resignation of the Sphinx,
and another says that Egypt is the best place in
the world to rest, and recommends that one “go
600 or 700 miles up the Nile before the season
opens and occupy a hotel alone. You will find
each day at least forty-eight hours long, and
you will think of nothing but Egyptian antiquities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and Arabs, both of which are wonderfully
soothing to the tired mind.”</p>

<p>Egypt may be likened to a woman with coloring
and charm, who surpasses sometimes in attraction
another of more beautiful and regular
form. In this land of golden light, of perpetual
sunshine, lived and moved the Egyptian queen.
Different and yet the same as her sisters of to-day,
now she seemed a goddess in might and
beauty, and again as the meanest of her slaves,
swayed by ambitions, torn by passions, swept by
waves of love and hate—a woman still. Each in
turn played her little part on the stage of life
and passed beyond the curtain, leaving a few,
and but few, traces of her existence. Passed into
“the land which loveth silence,” the dim Amenti
of the gods.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_2">CHAPTER SECOND.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE QUEEN.</span></h2>

<p>Egyptian Queens! What a picture their
name seems to call up of old time splendors—of
the light of Eastern skies, the soft breath of
eternal summer—of the great river Nile as a
beneficent deity, of monuments and palaces, gardens
and waving palm trees—houses with gorgeous
coloring, of princes and slaves—all
mingled on the tapestry of time!</p>

<p>In an age sometimes called “the Woman’s
Era,” when woman has become a subject of
analytical study to herself and to man, it may be
interesting to turn from the varieties of the
“New Woman” to the very old. Even on the
borderland of mythology she asserts a strange
individuality and is vitalized for us in the pages
of history and legend.</p>

<p>The Western woman on the stage of life is
ever a prominent figure. The Eastern has held
a place in the background, giving glimpses only
of her real self, always a veiled form, with dark,
shining eyes, merely suggestive of beauty and
charm. It may be matter of surprise, therefore,
to some, that in the most ancient of lands—or
among the most ancient of peoples, Eastern beyond
dispute, woman held an almost modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
place. In this, in some respects, advanced civilization,
religiously, politically and socially she
took her share in the world’s work and pleasure,
and was deemed, not the ignorant child or inferior
of Semitic lands, but the friend, the associate,
the equal of man.</p>

<p>The Queen was the companion of her royal
spouse, not his mere slave and toy. From the
time of the Second Dynasty she frequently ruled,
as the king’s guardian in youth, as regent in his
absence, or as independent sovereign after his
decease, or in right of heredity. The succession
was continued on the maternal equally with the
paternal side, and it was at times through the
female, and not through the male parent, that
the king traced his right to the throne.</p>

<p>Among the nobility also the same custom, to
a degree, obtained. The son of the eldest daughter
was sometimes the heir. Thus we read in
the time of Sneferu of his “great legitimate
daughter, Nefret-Kari,” and her son was “High
Treasurer.” In the hieroglyphic system after female
appellations, such as queen, wife, mother,
daughter, and the like, the figure of a seated
woman appears usually on a modest stool.</p>

<p>On the monuments the queen is always treated
as an official personage, she shares the king’s
honors and her name, like her husband’s, is enclosed
in a cartouch. We know more of her
public than of her private life.</p>

<p>As a rule, to which there were exceptions, the
king had but one legal wife, of high or royal
birth, the daughter of “the god,” as the late king
was called, and hence she was in many instances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in the strange Egyptian fashion, her husband’s
sister. One needs surely a different standard
from the Christian to judge of the morals of
Egypt. The marriage of a brother and sister,
so abhorrent to our ideas, was frequent in the
Royal Family, nor does nature herself, at that
period, seem to have set upon it the same mark
of disapprobation that one might expect. It began
in the heavens with the gods, who, according
to Egyptian mythology, did not dwell on
earth, and why should not humanity follow their
example. Osiris and Isis were both brother and
sister, husband and wife. Nor could the gods
any more than men get on without magic. Even
the statues of the former wore amulets as a protection
against evil and death, and used mystic
formulae to constrain each other. Isis was
above all the mistress of magic and famous in
incantations.</p>

<p>To her royal spouse the queen is spoken of as
“thy beloved sister who fills the palace with
light,” or “thy sister who is in thine heart, who
sits near thee at the feast,” or “thy beloved sister
with whom thou dost love to speak.” A love
song in which the woman seems the wooer is
preserved and we give one stanza.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Thou beloved one my wish is to be with thee as thy wife;</div>
<div class="verse">That thy arm may lie upon my arm.</div>
<div class="verse">Will not my elder brother come to-night?</div>
<div class="verse">Otherwise I am as one who lies in the grave.</div>
<div class="verse">For art thou not health and light?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The other ladies of the harem are also occasionally
called sisters. “Sutem Mut” was the
Royal Mother, “Sutem Hempt,” the Royal Wife.
Under the old empire the queen was spoken of
as “she who sees the gods, Horus and Set (that
is possessor of both halves of the kingdom), the
most pleasant, the highly praised, the friend of
Horus, the beloved of Ra, who wears the two
diadems.” In the New Empire she was designated
as “the consort of the god, the mother of
the god, the great consort of the king.” She
was eligible to all but the highest offices of the
priesthood and held forth or played the sacred
sistrum to the gods, sometimes dedicating herself
to one deity, while her husband served another,
and she deemed it the greatest honor to be called
“the concubine of the god.”</p>

<p>All women desired the name of Hathor, Isis,
the goddess of Love and Fecundity, as in the
Middle Ages the name of Mary, the mother of
Christ, was specially cherished. Other popular
names under the Old Empire signified “Beautiful,”
“Strong,” etc. Under the new we also find
“Beautiful,” and in addition the names of trees,
somewhat in Japanese fashion, with their “Cherry
Blossom” and “Plum Blossom,” as “Beautiful
Sycamore,” or, hardly admirable in the eyes of
the Greeks or ourselves, “Large Headed,” which
some of their coiffures and head ornamentations
seemed to suggest.</p>

<p>The sons and daughters of the late king were
always called the children of the god. The education
of both was conducted by the most
learned men of the kingdom, frequently priests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and this tutor was spoken of as the “nurse.”
The custom of entrusting the royal ladies to such
severe training reminds us of the preceptors and
studies of Queen Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey.
The queen held property in her own right. At
one time the revenues from the fisheries of Lake
Moeris were appropriated to her. A talent a
day, or upwards of 700 pounds a year. Also the
returns from certain cities; as, for example, the
taxes on wines of the city of Anthylla, were a
queen’s dowry for her dress, and this privilege
was continued to the queens of Persia after
Cambyses conquered Egypt.</p>

<p>After death, at least from the Eighteenth Dynasty,
divine honors were frequently paid to the
queen, and especially was this the case of Queens
Aah-hotep and Nefertari, the ancestresses of the
race of kings who drove out and succeeded the
Hyksos, the usurping rulers, and restored Egypt
to its native sovereigns.</p>

<p>The palaces were usually of brick, as the temples
were of stone adorned with gorgeously
painted walls and furnished with carpets, rugs
of skin and ebony and ivory chairs and couches.
The queen was attended by slaves, and some favored
maid or official bore beside her a fan of
ostrich plumes. She wore in later periods the
double crown of Egypt and presided beside the
king at feasts, where men and women, with unveiled
faces (veiling being an introduction of
the Persians), enjoyed themselves together.
They decorated each other with flowers, which
already in profusion adorned the drinking vessels,
listened to music and watched the dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of female slaves, the feats of jugglers, etc. Monkeys
were sometimes trained to act as torchbearers,
and we can imagine the confusion occasionally
engendered when one or another of
them, bursting, so to speak, the bands of conventionality,
reverted to his naturally mischievous
impulses and cast his flaming torch into the
midst of the festivities. Lions, leopards, dogs,
and the specially sacred cats were all numbered
among the pets.</p>

<p>The cat, it is said, was created in the ark,
hence the Garden of Eden, “where the comforts
of home were incompletely organized,” lacked
that ornament of the domestic hearth. But by
the Egyptians she was, above all, valued and
adored. They mourned for her as for a dear
and familiar friend, and woe to the man who,
even by accident, compassed her destruction.
She is most pleasingly set forth by one who evidently
admired and appreciated her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A little lion, small and dainty sweet</div>
<div class="verse indent7">(For such there be),</div>
<div class="verse">With sea-grey eyes and softly stepping feet,</div>
<div class="verse indent7">She prayed of me.</div>
<div class="verse">For this, through lands Egyptian far away,</div>
<div class="verse indent7">She bade me pass;</div>
<div class="verse">But in an evil hour I said her nay;</div>

<div class="verse indent7">Arsinoe,</div>
<div class="verse">With gifts of furry creatures white and dun</div>
<div class="verse indent7">From over sea.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Till the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty there
was little change in female attire. A fine linen
garment, through which the limbs could be
plainly seen, extended from below the breast to
the ankle, sometimes supported by straps over
the shoulders, and sometimes so narrow as to
require not even these. Colored robes were used
less frequently. To the man was left in those
days, as to the male bird, the gayer plumage.
The woman contented herself with the use of
oils and cosmetics, blackening her brows and
eyes, leaving her hair flowing, bound by a fillet,
or with braided locks, or a wig, and encircling
arms and limbs with innumerable chains
and bracelets. The queen wore a royal head-dress,
with the asp, emblem of the sun-god Ra,
over her forehead, and the vulture, dedicated to
Maut, mother of Isis, above. The golden disk
is said to be an emblem of the eternal sunshine,
the entwining asp of the winding Nile, and the
outspread wings of Upper and Lower Egypt,
extending along the river.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevenson mentions innumerable texts
which refer to the god as hidden in the disk,
whilst a winged goddess makes light with her
feathers, with which light and heat are always
associated. The mother goddess of Thebes,
Mut, in the shape of a vulture, spreads her
wings and says, “I cover thy couch and give life
to die back of thy neck.” And the mother of
the sun-god at the moment of birth brings her
own life “to the back of his neck in flame.” The
disk amulet was put under a mummy to preserve
the vital heat The winged disk, emblem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
heaven, was, in primeval times, conceived as a
bird, which, under its embodiment as the hawk,
had come to dwell in the sun. “In the Eighteenth
Dynasty this symbol over monuments
was supposed to guard and protect, and played
in Egypt the role that the winged bull of the
Assyrians played on the banks of the Euphrates.”</p>

<p>A poetic fancy has thus painted the queen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Pen, pencil, brush, and I may add imagination,
have depicted for us the royal surroundings.
The reigning queen had, like all sovereigns, her
tasks to perform. Reports from all parts of the
kingdom to receive, the regulation of laws, the
commerce and the domestic affairs of her dominions.
Luxury surrounded her, attendants
and slaves waited upon her bidding. Gold, silver,
precious stones and valuable stuffs composed
her furniture, her table-service and her
attire. Scribes indited at her dictation and royal
papyrus bore the impress of her signet, upon
which vermilion was rubbed from a small
cushion, while blue and a somewhat different
stamp was used in religious matters. She dwelt
among columns, statues and sphinxes, and, always
adorned with flowers and jewels, wore
over her shoulders, when in the character of a
priestess, the leopard skin of the sacrificer. As
special honor to any subject she would bestow
upon him a chain of gold and put a ring on his
finger. Her throne of ivory was sometimes said
to have been so finely carved that a breath would
move the foliage represented upon it.</p>

<p>Such in general outline was the position of the
Egyptian Queen. But when we approach the
individual the difficulties in the study of personality
are manifold. Frequently hundreds of
years pass and no queen’s name appears—the
roll of dynasty after dynasty is searched in vain.
In most cases this is enhanced by many names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
being applied to the same individual, as they
are derived from ancient Egyptian, Greek, Persian,
or other sources. To this one adds what
is called the “Ka” name, a sort of religious addition
to the original cognomen.</p>

<p>A parallel to all this might be found in the
case of the Duke of Argyle, date 1734, who was
also known as John Campbell, MacCallum More,
and Ian Roy Cean. The titular, family, and by,
or nick-name, signifying “red-headed.” A person
searching the archives of Scotland a thousand
years hence might be as bewildered in
such a case as the Egyptian student is now.</p>

<p>Different authorities give dates hundreds of
years apart, different names to the same person,
and different spelling to the same name. Some
of the queens were taken for men, and only in
later and more exhaustive researches was their
sex and position ascertained. Nor is this to be
wondered at, when the various parts of speech
applied to them are of the male gender. Yet
here and there a fragment is discovered and we
learn something, at least, of many of them.</p>

<p>The partial list extends from the earliest times
to the Roman period. Late discoveries give us
fragmentary remains from the First Dynasty,
but Mertytefs of the Fourth seems the first distinct
personality, and the roll, virtually beginning
with her, ends with the last and most celebrated
Cleopatra. Two of these figures at least
stand out with wonderful clearness, the great
Hatasu, of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and this
same Cleopatra, and while of many others we
know much less, we in some cases possess their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
veritable jewels and ornaments, and in others
their actual mummies.</p>

<p>We are working, as it were, to restore a mutilated
mosaic. Some of the pieces are altogether
gone, many others broken and discolored.
From here and there we gather a fragment for
our task of restoration. They may vary in
shape, they may vary in tint, the recompleted
whole is diverse from the original, but it approximates—it
gives us an idea of what the perfect
design has been, and with that, for the present,
we must rest content.</p>

<span class="smaller">MERTYTEFS.</span></h2>

<p>Year by year the patient research of the archeologist
unearths new discoveries, confirming or
contradicting those already made, and translating,
as it were, into actual fact much that had
previously been considered legendary. And still,
year by year, till the whole history is laid bare,
the process is likely to continue. Comparatively
late discoveries at Abydos have converted the
mythical kings of the First Dynasty into real
human beings, living and dying thousands of
years ago. Their burial places have been found,
and Menes, Aha-Mena, is no longer a suppositious,
but a real character. Weapons, furniture,
vases, drinking vessels, jewelry, etc., with the
names of various kings upon them, have been
dug up and may now be seen at Abydos, in the
University Museum in London, in that of the
University of Pennsylvania, and in other places.</p>

<p>Among these we come upon the first memorial
of a queen. From out of the darkness of the
centuries stretches forth a woman’s arm laden
with bracelets, and tells of the common humanity
which unites us. It is thus described: “The
most important piece of gold work discovered
consists of the bracelets of the Queen of Zer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
The queen’s arm had been broken off long ago,
when the tomb was originally plundered, and
hidden in a hole in the wall. There it had been
overlooked alike by the builders of the Osiris
shrine, by the Coptic destroyers, and by the
Arabs employed by the French mission, until it
was discovered by Professor Petrie’s workmen,
with the four bracelets in their original order.
Each is made in a different and somewhat elaborate
design, partly in gold and partly in beads
of amethyst, turquoise or lazuli.” These “finds”
also include the tomb of a young girl, “Bener-Ab”
(Sweet of Heart), whom some fancied to
be the daughter of Ment, which contained an
ivory figure dressed in flowing robes. And still
another “find” includes some plaited locks and a
fringe of curly false hair.</p>

<p>The early Egyptian comes upon the historic
stage very much decorated as to head, very decollete
as to garments. No Indian with war paint
and feathers was more elaborately gotten up.
So that his peruke hung in curled or braided
locks about him, or, if of royal blood, he wore
his crown or double crown, all else seemed of
minor importance. We can imagine him lightly
attired, treading the streets of modern London
and straying into the law courts, where he would
encounter judges and barristers in their wigs of
office. Doubtless he would bow and touch his
head significantly, intimating that a common
bond of taste united them.</p>

<p>So important were these coiffures that one of
the earliest offices of which we find record is that
of “Superintendent of Wigs and Head-dresses,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and among the treasures of various museums
are specimens of these belongings of royalty.</p>

<p>Reproduced in almost every book on Egypt
are those most ancient portrait statues of General
Ra-hotep and his wife, the Princess Nefert.
One authority assigns them to the Third Dynasty,
and already the wig was in full flow. The
gentleman wears a comparatively modest head
covering, but the lady’s was of portentous size
and thickness, falling in curls on either side of
her face, with its artless, unaffected expression.
Doubtless the fashionable world of that day
thought the wig gave “a presence”—as an English
dame said of caps—to the wearer. General
Ra-hotep had married a lady of rank, of royal
blood, his superior in that respect, but both were
deemed important enough to have their massive
statues cut, sitting in the usual ceremonial attitude,
bolt upright, the knees and feet closely
pressed together. “A statue of dignity culminating
in a bust of beneficence.”</p>

<p>The Egyptian ideal was a studied dignity of
posture. The Greeks, aiming at the grace and
beauty of nature, sculptured their figures in the
various attitudes of the human form, as also, in
a degree, did the Romans. While we see on
coins and in old manuscripts the Saxon and early
Norman kings with knees and feet wide apart,
and this also is the ceremonial Chinese attitude.</p>

<p>But even with a formal prescribed position of
the figure the early Egyptian faces were evidently
true to nature to an extent not the case
in later times. There is an individuality about
them which makes us feel that we see a truthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
personification. In the Old Empire the realistic
school is found side by side with conventional
art. In the Fourth Dynasty especially we see
conventional figures and portrait heads, while in
the Fifth all is more natural. To this last belongs
the fine limestone statue of a scribe now in
the Louvre. A slender but powerful figure,
square in the shoulders, with slight legs and
long, flat feet, seated in an Oriental manner and
writing on a parchment unrolled on his knee.
The flesh tints a pale red, a false beard, bronze
for the brows, eyes enamelled alabaster and crystal,
and a nail for the pupil.</p>

<p>Another portrait statue of great celebrity is
that of the “wooden man” reproduced in a plaster
cast in almost every museum. It is half life-size,
probably the foreman of a gang of laborers,
is called “Ra Emka,” and was found at the Sakkarah
pyramid. Its age has been said to be six
thousand years. It had originally eyes of opaque
white quartz, pupils of rock crystal, bronze eyelids,
and arms made separately, with a staff of
office in one hand, and was once covered with
linen, plastered and painted. The Arabs called
it “Sheikel Belel, or Belud,” “Village Chief.” A
mutilated statue of his wife was found beside
him, only the head and trunk being entire. The
face was of the common Egyptian type, with
rather a peevish expression, in contrast to the
husband’s more urbane and amiable look. Statues
of a certain Sepi and his wife, attributed to
the Third Dynasty, are also in the Louvre.</p>

<p>The outline of the physiognomy of General
Ra-hotep and Ra-Emka are not unlike in type.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
The Princess Nefert has buff flesh tints, her husband’s
are somewhat darker, and both have the
crystal eyes which impart such a lifelike appearance.
A dignified and portly pair, who gaze
steadily out above the head of the sight-seer in
the Gizeh museum. This collection, first gathered
at Boulak and later removed to Gizeh, is
the youngest but the richest in portrait statues
of private individuals. Most are in what is
called the hieratic attitude, with the left arm
close to the body, the left hand holding a roll of
papyrus, the right leg advanced, the right hand
raised, as if grasping a staff, or perhaps, as at
the Resurrection, holding the Book of the Dead.
With Menes the first distinct record of dynasties
begins, so far as yet discovered, and mooted
points remain for the student as to which
reigned simultaneously and which in succession.
The first two dynasties were Thinites, from Tini,
Greek This, near Abydos, in Upper Egypt, seat
of the worship of Osiris, where their tombs and
various remains, as above referred to, have been
found. One of the most ancient is a fragment
of jewelry bearing the name of Mena, who is
said to have founded Memphis, to have turned
aside the course of the river to build his city, to
have reigned sixty-two years, and, finally, to
have been killed by a hippopotamus or crocodile.
Zer, or Teta, understood medicine and wrote astronomical
books; of others it is said that one
wrote the sacred books, another introduced animal
worship, and another was a giant. Of this
first dynasty there seem to have been some seven
or eight kings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>As early as the Second Dynasty, under Binothris,
a law was passed admitting women to
sovereignty, and thereafter, from time to time,
as guardian, regent, or independent ruler, a
woman held sway. As goddesses above, so the
woman below had her share of authority. The
queen by incantations protected the king when
in his priestly robe he offered sacrifices, played
the sistrum (a sort of religious instrument) to
drive away evil spirits, offered libations, poured
perfumes and cast flowers. She walked behind
the king in processions, gave audiences with him
and governed for him, as the goddess Isis for
Osiris, in his absence. The worship of the bull
Apis, destined to so wide a popularity, was also
introduced in this dynasty.</p>

<p>No extended or separate account of the
queens, with one or two exceptions, can be found
in the writers on Egypt, but here and there we
come across the mention of certain names and
brief stories or conflicting statements in regard
to them. Several are spoken of by Maspero in
his account of these earliest times. But to Mertytefs
or Mertitifsi chiefly clings any sort of history
which can vitalize her for us. We read of
Mirisonku, daughter of Kheops and sister and
wife of Khephren, of Mirtitifsi, of Khuit, of Miriri-ankh-nas,
and of Meri-s-ankh, of the Sixth
Dynasty, worshipper of the gods. Another
writer gives Meri-s-ankh as the queen of Sneferu
or Khafra, and Hentsen as Kufu’s daughter,
says that Hatshepset made scarabs of Menkaura,
and mentions a statue of Ra-en-usa, of
the Fifth Dynasty. A stele in Gizeh, found at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Abydos and of the Fifth Dynasty, represents the
royal spouse Pepi-ankhnes and the “chef” Aou
seated on each side of a table of offerings. The
city of This gave its name to the yet earliest
known kings, but Memphis, “The Haven of the
Good,” was the great metropolis in the time of
Mertitefs.</p>

<p>Queen Mertitefs is said to have been first the
wife of King Seneferu, “the Betterer,” whose
mother is given by one authority as Queen Hapunimait.
Mertytefs was, some say, of the
Third, some of the Fourth Dynasty. In a limestone
group in the Leyden Museum (among the
oldest portrait statues in the world) sit the
queen, the mysterious Ka, which may be briefly
described as the embodied spirit, and her secretary,
a priest named Kenun. Without a secretary
or scribe no royal personage’s list of attendants
was complete. It was hardly the private
correspondence which occupied their time,
as in later days, though the habit of letter writing
then existed, but so many items had to be
noted down. The queen and her Ka sit side by
side, with black hair and buff flesh tints just
alike.</p>

<p>Seneferu, founder of the Fourth Dynasty, is
the first king of whom we have contemporary
monuments, and the Fourth is sometimes called
the “pyramid dynasty.” During this reign the
kingdom was prosperous, the arts flourished,
and foreign conquests were made. The king left
a good name, and was worshipped till the Ptolemaic
period.</p>

<p>Diodorus stated that in the marriage contracts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the wife was to control her husband. Be that as
it may, she was doubtless, as in modern times,
the ruler of the household. Mertytefs was
young, some say fourteen, and probably beautiful,
when she married Seneferu, whom she survived,
and, possessing the usual charm of widows,
she again married the Cheops of Herodotus,
the Khufu of Manetho, of whom a small
ivory has been recently found by Professor Petrie
at Abydos, the builder of the Great Pyramid.
Marriette assigns the date 4234 B. C., and
Brugsch 3733 B. C. to this period, while Petrie
gives from the time of the First Dynasty to the
Sixth 4777 B. C. to 3503 B. C. Some writers
interpolate a certain Ratatef, sometimes said to
be the son, sometimes the brother of Khufu.</p>

<p>The building of a pyramid as his sepulchre
was one of the chief occupations, might almost
say the amusements or pleasures, of a king, as
the building of a house in modern times affords
constant study and entertainment to the constructor,
and day after day he goes to watch its
progress. The thought of death had no terror
for the Egyptians—to the king it was simply a
new world, peopled with gods and goddesses,
among whom he would take an honored place.
His pyramid was the book, the autobiography,
often an illustrated one, that he published, filled
with accounts of his deeds and prowess and certain
to give him name and fame with posterity.
The word pyramid is said to mean “king’s
grave,” and thus reveals its purpose.</p>

<p>So, slowly, under the eyes of Queen Mertytefs
rose these gigantic and marvellous structures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
What matter, if the object were accomplished,
that hundreds of lives were sacrificed in
the ceaseless and laborious toil under a tropic
sun. Herodotus says it took one hundred thousand,
Pliny three hundred thousand, men twenty
years in the building. We can imagine the
queen from time to time going in state to view
the progress of the work and helping it on with
her suggestions. Some traditions tell that Khufu
was specially tyrannical and cruel, and even
stopped praying to the gods to press on his
great enterprise. The rock testimony styles him
brave and a conqueror.</p>

<p>“Egypt is the monumental land of the earth,
as the Egyptians are the monumental people,”
says Bunsen. The history of Egypt goes, as it
were, against the stream; the earliest monuments
are between Cairo and Siout, in Lower
Egypt, the latest temples in Nubia, Upper Egypt.</p>

<p>The pyramids, whose entrances pointed to the
North star, and which were perhaps two thousand
years old when Abraham was born, looked
from a distance like isolated mountain peaks or
faint blue triangles outlined against the sky, and
the clear air made them seem nearer than they
were. They occupied the whole horizon as one
advanced beyond the plain of tombs. “Anear,”
says Miss Edwards, “a mighty shadow, sharp
and distinct, divided the sunlight where it fell,
as its great original divided the sunlight in the
upper air and darkened the space it covered like
an eclipse—registering sixty centuries of history.”
In the early times the three large pyramids
were probably almost central in the embrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the city, which stretched away westward from
the Nile in “a succession of gardens, squares,
palaces and monuments, girdling the lake with
beautiful villages and climbing, with its terraces,
grottoes, shrines and marble pavilions, the very
sides of the cliffs two leagues from the Nile.
From the top of the great pyramid of Cheops
to-day one views the broad domes and the minarets
of Cairo, the hills beyond and a palm grove
on the site of ancient Memphis,” says Bayard
Taylor. “Over the rich palm trees the blue
streak of the river and the plain beyond you see
the phantoms of two pyramids in the haze which
still curtains the Libyan desert. Northward, beyond
the parks and palaces of Shoba, the Nile
stretches his two great arms towards the sea,
dotted far into the distance with sails that flash
in the sun.” Many other pyramids are in sight,
while higher than St. Peter’s, Rome, St. Paul’s,
London, or the Capitol at Washington, the
greatest of them, this enormous structure of past
ages still dominates the plain. A modern poet
has said of them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Amid the deserts of a mystic land,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Like Sibyls waiting for a doom far-seen,</div>
<div class="verse">Apart in awful solitude they stand,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With thoughts unending caravan between.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even then it was probably a magnificent city
in which Queen Mertytefs dwelt. Colossal gateways,
with the disk and extended wings above,
pillars on which lights burned at night, avenues
of sphinxes, palaces along the river bank, columns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
with carved capitals, with the lotus in bud
and bloom, as well as other plants, and gorgeously
painted shafts, temples of red sandstone,
with forests of pillars, lakes surrounded with
trees and flowering shrubs, oranges, scarlet
pomegranates, olives, figs, vines, and everywhere
crowds of freemen and troops of slaves.</p>

<p>The Sphinx, previously sculptured, doubtless
underwent some work of restoration at this
time, and is said by certain authorities to bear
the features of Chephren aggrandized, by others
that it was in the image of the god Harmachis.
The Arabs named it “Abuthol, Father of Terrors.”
Its present state called forth from an illiterate
voyager of modern times the caustic remark,
“They keep it in shocking repair!” Maspero
believed the Sphinx belonged to the period
of the Horshesu, “Followers of Horus,” chiefs
of the clans gathered into one kingdom under
Menes.</p>

<p>The Book of the Dead, which laid down rules,
as we may say, both for the dead and the living,
belonged to the Fourth Dynasty, and the fragments
of it which have descended to us are the
source of much of our information about this
ancient land and people.</p>

<p>Besides the serious business of pyramid building,
the kings and queens had their amusements
of other sorts. The harp and flute were known
in the Fourth Dynasty, and music, singing and
dancing no doubt date from the Garden of Eden.
Dwarfs were favorite pets, and a story is told of
a frolic of King Seneferu’s, who, for diversion,
kept a boat manned with girls whose airy costumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
consisted of network. Perchance he may
not have been so sober-minded a person as his
successor in the queen’s affections. Khufu built
the Great Pyramid, and perhaps rebuilt the temple
of Isis near the Sphinx, also a temple at Denderah,
added to or restored later, first by Thothmes IV
and afterwards by some of the Ptolemies.</p>

<p>Mertytefs or Khufu’s sons and daughters are
spoken of by Rawlinson, and a daughter, Hents
or Hentsen, was buried under a small pyramid
near her father. There is a tradition that he
sold his daughter for money to carry on the
building of his pyramid, while she, sharing in
the profits, built one for herself. The king consecrated
gold and copper statues to Isis in honor
of his daughter. Other stories tell of treasures
buried in the pyramids which were appropriated
by the sovereigns of other centuries.</p>

<p>Tutors, or “nurses,” as they were called, were
appointed for the royal children, and possibly
the queen’s secretary, Kenun, may have held this
position. Record is made of a certain Shap-siska-fankhu,
who was governor of the “House
of the Royal Children,” in the Fifth Dynasty.
Shafra or Khafra was thought to be son-in-law
to Khufu and his wife; Meri-ankh-s, or Meri-s-ankh,
whose tomb is at Sakkarah, was a priestess
of the god Thoth. She was high in confidence
and favor, and bore at least two sons.
Her husband, or another son of Khufu, was high
priest at Heliopolis.</p>

<p>Mertytefs was evidently a lady of great vigor,
capacity and attraction, for two reigns did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
exhaust her powers, and under the succeeding
king, Kafra or Chafra, probably son-in-law or
nephew, and builder of the second pyramid of
Gizeh, she still in a measure held sway. The
name signified “beloved of her father,” but she
was evidently beloved of fortune also, for her
sun sinks in splendor as the “Administrator of
the Great Hall of the Palace,” where she had
probably innumerable slaves to oversee and do
her bidding, “Mistress of the Royal Wardrobe”
and “Superintendent of the Chamber of Wigs
and Head-dresses”—three important offices. Yet
are women of forty on the Nile said to be as
old as those of sixty in Europe. Not this lady
surely, else were her brilliant career briefly run.
To account for this singular history one commentator
allows her a hundred and six years,
another a hundred and thirty. A lady’s age is
always a mystery. Perhaps she never told it,
but “let concealment, like a worm in the bud,
feed on her damask cheek,” and after these
lapses of centuries it may be we shall never be
set right on this point.</p>

<p>The statue of King Chefren, with his novel
head-dress, serene expression, and paucity of
underwear, is familiar, but the upper class figures
were always more conventional, the lower
more realistic. A new king meant usually a new
city, a new palace, and a new tomb, and architecture
flourished in these distant periods.</p>

<p>The duties of the Queen Dowager were doubtless
arduous. “Administrator of the Great Hall”
probably included the direction and control of a
large retinue of servants and the preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for feast and audiences. “Mistress of the Royal
Wardrobe” was perhaps a less onerous position,
owing to the brevity of the then fashionable costume.
At some periods men wore but two garments,
women but one—a sort of narrow chemise
of fine linen, through which the limbs could
be plainly seen, with or without a strap over the
shoulders. Another costume was a light skirt
with long shoulder straps and bound by a girdle,
the ends falling in front. Over this usually a
full skirt of fine linen, with sleeves below the elbows
and broad skirt falling to the ground.</p>

<p>Both men and women adorned themselves
with necklaces and bracelets, and used stibium
to darken under the eyelids—while the nails,
hands and feet were stained with henna, which
gave them an orange tint. Occasionally, also, an
added decoration was a line drawn from the corner
of the eye to the temple. In the earliest
times foot covering was seldom worn indoors.</p>

<p>But to be “Superintendent of the Chamber
of Wigs and Head-dresses” could have been no
sinecure. Wigs! Wigs! Wigs! We can
imagine them in the room devoted to them, on
shelves, in boxes, and on stands. Upon this
department of his wardrobe the Egyptian spent
much time and care. With head closely shaven,
and frequently the chin also divested of all natural
endowment, he had unlimited opportunity
to add what he considered improvement of an
artificial character. He wore a manufactured
beard, caps of a striped material, and wigs made
both of human hair and sheep’s wool. The wigs
consisted of rows of little curls beginning at different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
points and cut round and square. The
shorter covered the head or neck, and the longer
lay on the shoulders; a wig in the Berlin museum
shows both short curls and long. In other
instances braids and plaits were preferred to
curls. The peculiarity of the Egyptian head
was a prominent back, and this doubtless had to
be considered in the shape of the wig selected.
The pages who served the king and queen in
their private apartments often wore a crown of
natural flowers.</p>

<p>The women appear usually to have worn the
wigs over their own hair, which sometimes escaped
below. It also hung down in two tresses
on the breast, and the young princes wore a
side lock before the ear, as did the youthful god
Horus. So much pride did females take in their
hair that an especially fine lock was sometimes
cut off and buried with them.</p>

<p>It was all deemed an important subject. A certain
Shapsesre of later time, superintendent at
court, a wig-maker by profession, had four statues
of himself made for his tomb, each with a
different style of wig!</p>

<p>The king wore a sort of handkerchief, a cap,
or a helmet. The white crown of Upper Egypt
was a curious, high, white, conical cap; that of
Lower Egypt was red, had a high, narrow back
and a metal ornament bent obliquely forward.
They were, after a time, worn together. The
upreared uraeus or asp was the sign of royalty.
The goddess Ra-nu was represented with the
asp which was worn by the queen, with the addition
of the vulture with drooping or outspread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
wings, the winged sum disk and other costly
head-dresses.</p>

<p>A great stele found at the pyramid of Gizeh
is dedicated to the memory of a princess who,
after being a great favorite in the court of Seneferu
and Khufu, was subsequently attached to
the private house of Kafra, and her history
seems to run strangely parallel with that of the
queen—if she herself be not intended.</p>

<p>Four or five thousand years before Christ are
the dates assigned to this period. We must
grope and work somewhat at random in the reconstruction
of our mosaic. Yet does Queen
Mertytefs stand out with a certain lifelikeness.
Imagination plays around her active figure, and
she looks out at us from the shadows, not with
languorous, soft glances and gentle movements,
but with vivacity and power in her black eyes
and an attractive and capable face. None but a
woman of power and capacity, we may be sure,
could have been “Administrator of the Great
Hall.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_4">CHAPTER FOURTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">NITOCRIS.</span></h2>

<p>The Sixth Dynasty is illustrated by the name
of Queen Nitocris. Famed, and it may be
fabled, the obliterating touch of the centuries
has yet spared something of her personality.
The “most beautiful and spirited woman of her
time” is the record that comes down to us from
very ancient sources, and “rosy-cheeked” the epithet
applied to her. She was the last sovereign
of her dynasty, but first we must glance at a
few, less noted, that preceded her.</p>

<p>Dynasty after dynasty was named according
to the great cities of the provinces, and to the
Fifth by some, or by others to the Sixth, was
applied the term Elephantines, from the city of
Elephantine, in Syene. According to certain
authorities, the First, Second and Third Dynasties
of Manetho were ruling at This, while his
Fourth and Sixth held sway at Memphis, and
during a portion of the time his Fifth at Elephantine,
Ninth at Heliopolis and Eleventh at
Thebes or Diospolis. It is almost impossible to
tell which of the families or monarchs were contemporary,
or which ruled in succession. To
unravel this tangled skein of history is beyond
the sphere of the present work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>With Manetho’s Second and Fourth Dynasty
we reach the testimony of the monuments, which
is perhaps the chief source of information. The
Egyptians painted everything but the hardest
and most valuable stone, and both brush and
chisel have furnished something of our partial
and fragmentary story. Our princesses lived in
a blaze of color, in radiant sunshine, and amid
rainbow tints, sheltered by walls “lined throughout
with Oriental alabaster and stained with the
orange flush of Egyptian sunsets.”</p>

<p>The winged sun disk, as a symbol, makes its
appearance for the first time on monuments of
the Fifth Dynasty, a simple disk between two
wings inclining downward. Under the Sixth it
was more conventionalized, the wings were
straightened out and the asp added. At one
place Pepi I appears protected on one side by
a flying hawk and on the other by a disk, evidently
regarded as equivalent. To the Fifth Dynasty
also belong the precepts of Patah-hotep,
which were found in what is called the “Prisse”
papyrus in Paris. “This,” says the script, “is
the teaching of the governor Patah-hotep, under
his Majesty, King Assa—long may he live.”
This monarch appears to have been the first
Pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty and the first who
had the two names, the throne and the ordinary
name. The last, Unas, constructed a great truncated
pyramid, now called Mastaba, or “Pharaoh’s
seat,” north of the pyramids of Dahshour.</p>

<p>King Shepseskaf, near or at the close of the
Fifth Dynasty, who had been adopted by King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Mencheres, gave to a highly favored page in his
household the hand of his eldest daughter, the
Princess Maat-kha. Less frequently than in
modern times were foreign alliances sought, and
thus the husband often mounted to a higher rung
on the social ladder, or even to the throne itself,
assisted by the hand of his wife.</p>

<p>The first female name that attracts attention
in the Sixth Dynasty is that of Queen Shesh,
mother of the king Tete or Pepe. This name
occurs in the Hindoo mythology as that of the
king of serpents. Whether she showed the wisdom
attributed to the serpent or not may be
questioned. At any rate we do not find her occupied
with matters of state; essentially her interest
lay in domestic affairs, but, even so, her
name has come down to posterity. She invented
a world-famed pomade, since, after the lapse of
centuries, we can still read of it. The usual ingredients
were the tooth of a donkey boiled with
dog’s foot and dates; but the royal lady struck
out boldly and substituted the hoof for the tooth
of the former beast. And who knows the saving
virtues or beautifying qualities of this compound,
which perhaps entitled her majesty to
the honors of a Lydia Pinkham, a blessing to all
her sex.</p>

<p>In the Sixth Dynasty were several kings of
the name of Pepi or Pepy, and the long reign of
one of them, Pepi-Merira, is much celebrated.
According to the Greeks, it lasted a hundred
years. Of his first wife, Antes, we know nothing
but her name; perchance she died early, and
probably bore no sons. His second wife and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
queen, Merera-Ankes, is more noted; even the
names of her parents have been preserved. Her
father Khua, her mother Neke-bit, and her two
sons, Merenra and Nofer-ka-ra, while among
the more extensive ruins is a tomb at Abydos,
the last resting place of this queen.</p>

<p>To “go to Abydos” was the equivalent of
speaking of a death. It was the sacred place of
the Egyptians, the tomb of Osiris, around which
the Isis and Osiris legends gathered; where
Mena of This, the founder of Memphis, and all
the succeeding monarchs of his dynasty were
buried. The Step pyramid at Sakkarah, said to
be the oldest, is thought to belong to the First
Dynasty, Medoom to the Third, and Gizeh to the
Fourth. The Fifth Dynasty seems to have been
priestly. The oldest dated papyrus of this period
was, in 1893, found at Sakkarah, while the
figure of Menkahor was found at the Serapeum.
The Sixth Dynasty was said to be more limited
in power, and some of the minor principalities
to have recovered their independence, while in
the latter part of the time civil strife broke out,
and it was followed by a new race till the Eleventh,
though some of the native princes are believed
to have still ruled at Memphis.</p>

<p>But to return to the queens. One authority
speaks of Queen Amitsi, “great spouse of the
king,” and her mother, the Princess Nibit, who,
of royal blood, transmitted rights to her daughter,
which would have made her heir to the
throne in the early part of the Sixth Dynasty.
The brief mention of this queen and of Queen
Merera-anknes are not altogether reconcilable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
but may perhaps apply to the same person.
Queen Merera-anknes is said not to have been
of royal blood, or if it be the same lady her
claim to high lineage probably came from the
mother’s side. Whatever her origin, she was
evidently well appreciated, since even the names
of her relatives were preserved. She at first bore
some other cognomen, but after coronation
adopted that by which she is known in history,
and which couples, in a measure, her own and
her husband’s. The inscription on her tomb—on
the tablet on which is a figure of Pepi—reads
“royal wife of Merira, great in all things, companion
of Horus, mother of Meren-ra.” There
can be little doubt that she was specially devoted
to the service of the gods, and the priests were
glad to hand down in laudatory inscriptions her
name and fame to later generations.</p>

<p>There is a mention of Pepi-Merira who “executed
works to Hathor” at Denderah, a temple
which shows traces of the hand of various kings
from the earliest to the latest period. The end
of this reign was also distinguished by a festival
inaugurating a new period of years, called
“Hib-set, the Festival of the Tail,” on the principle,
perhaps, on which the close of college exercises
is called “Commencement,” in which we
may be sure Queen Merari-Anknes bore a distinguished
part.</p>

<p>The eldest son, Meren-ra, succeeded his father,
but him also his mother survived, for in
the reign of the second son, Nofer-ka-ra, she
takes a prominent position, if not a distinct
share in the government, and her name on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
monuments seems to occupy as important a place
as does that of the king.</p>

<p>A sort of Nestor among these royal personages
was a certain Una, or U’ne, a favorite minister
of more than one of the sovereigns. He
was highly trusted and employed on various important
embassies. His records, saved from destruction,
form a valuable link in the historic
chain. He speaks of Pepi in terms now used by
the faithful of the Pope, as “his Holiness.” He
chronicles foreign wars for the extension of territory,
expeditions in search of stone and other
materials for the usual duty and pleasure, the
building of the king’s tomb; and last, perhaps
most interesting of all in connection with the
queens, the private trial of one of these rulers.
Entese, queen of one of the Pepys, was the person
in question. The king evidently wished not
to spread the scandal, whatever it might be, and
Una and one other official were alone present.
It is the autobiography of this somewhat voluble
minister which gives us the fragment of the
story, that, like many others, lacks its termination.
Perhaps he did not dare to write the conclusion;
perhaps that part of the work has disappeared,
or perhaps when the matter ceased to
include himself he lost interest. We wish, if our
final supposition is correct, that this had not
been the case, and we wish also that, knowing
so much, we knew a little more; whether the lady
was found innocent or guilty, and whether she
was forgiven or met with a tragic fate.</p>

<p>Says Una: “When the lawsuit was conducted
secretly in the royal household against the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
consort, Entese, his Majesty ordered me to appear
to conduct the proceedings—I alone, no
chief judge, nor governor, nor prince was present—I
alone, because I was agreeable and pleasant
to the heart of his Majesty, and because his
Majesty loved me. I myself, I compiled the
written report—I alone and one single judge belonging
to the town Nechent. Yet formerly my
office was only that of a superintendent of the
royal anterior country, and no one in my position
had ever in earlier times heard the secret of
the royal household. I alone was excepted; his
Majesty allowed me to hear them, because I was
more agreeable to the heart of his Majesty than
all his princes, than all his nobles, and than all
his servants.” The sentences are fairly spangled
with “I’s,” all other capitals being in abeyance.
He quite hugs himself, does the good Una, over
his virtues and his honors. He has caught something
of the self-glorifying spirit which distinguished
so many of the sovereigns. The other
judge does not seem to count for much; the
queen herself is rather in the background. Yet
the naivete of this old world reporter—like that
quality in all ages—is not without its charm.</p>

<p>We are reminded of Pepys in the seventeenth
century and of Boswell in the eighteenth. “Boswell,”
said Dr. Johnson, meeting the biographer
on the street, “I have been reading some of your
manuscripts. There is a good deal about yourself
in them. They seem to me Youmoirs rather
than Memoirs.” We laugh a little in our sleeves
perhaps at this early Jack Horner, “who put in
his thumb and pulled out a plum, and said what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
a good boy am I.” But we are grateful for the
realistic pictures he gives us, and feel the touch
of a common humanity which, the world over,
from the beginning to the end of time, shows the
same virtues and foibles, whatever its racial
characteristics or its national individualities.</p>

<p>So the royal Vashti disappears into the shades
and some happier Esther takes her place. Evidently
Entese did not win the favor that did
Queen Merari-anknes; no laudatory inscription
on monument or tomb bears her name as companion
of the gods.</p>

<p>The ambition for larger territory and foreign
wars seemed to stifle, as it usually does, the artistic
spirit, and few such marvels of sculpture
and portrait statues are attributed to the Sixth
Dynasty as have made the preceding the wonder
of all following ages.</p>

<p>A woman’s name illumines this period, and
with the beautiful Queen Nitocris the dynasty
comes to an end. Nitocris is not a usual name
in Egyptian history, but we find it occasionally
mentioned there and elsewhere. In later times
it was borne by a daughter of Psammetic I,
whose sarcophagus is preserved. Some of the
early writers on Egypt, coming to conclusions
hastily from insufficient data and previous to the
more modern discoveries, made a sort of composite
photograph of a queen by combining the
brief history of several with some of the more
individual characteristics of the great Hatasu,
and called it Nitocris, but time has shown them
to have been mistaken. Two traditions exist—those
derived from Manetho and those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
compilers from the remains at Abydoh and Sakkarah
and the author of the Turin papyrus.</p>

<p>Another celebrated queen of ancient history
was called Nitocris, and about her, too, the
clouds of mist and fable enwreathe themselves.
This was Queen Nitocris of Babylon, who lived
five hundred generations after the warlike Semiramis.
She turned the course of the Euphrates
to make navigation winding and difficult, that
thus the city might be preserved from the attacks
of enemies. She ordered that she should
be buried in a chamber above one of the gates,
through which for a long time after none were
willing to pass. She also promised treasure to
the king who, in great necessity and in straits
only, should open her sepulchre, but when at
last Darius sought to avail himself of this he
merely found an abusive sentence for disturbing
her.</p>

<p>The Egyptian Nitocris, according to Herodotus,
who derived his tradition from Manetho,
lived 3066 years B. C., while to her dynasty he
assigned 206 years, but the Turin papyrus and
other records disprove this last. These dates, if
bearing any relation to fact (for upon this point
authorities differ so widely), seem almost like
the astonishing figures with which the astronomer
leads us from world to world in his celestial
researches, and our imagination finds difficulty
in grasping such periods, nor is it strange
that they are so seriously questioned by many
students.</p>

<p>Queen Nitocris’ name appears among a list
of three hundred and thirty monarchs, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
duration of her reign is said to have been twelve
years. A sort of Cinderella legend attaches to
her. An eagle carried off the sandal of the
beautiful maiden and dropped it before the
prince, who was sitting in an open air court in
his office as judge. At once he was fired with
a desire to find the owner of that bewitching
slipper, who when found became the royal consort.</p>

<p>In the earliest times, as before mentioned, even
the noblest in the land wore no foot-covering
within doors, and though sandals were more common
later, under the New Empire they were frequently
carried by an attendant slave and always
put off in the presence of superiors. They were
made of leather or papyrus, with straps passing
over the instep, and between the toes, and occasionally
a third strap to support the heel. Sometimes,
especially for solemn occasions, they were
made with a peak turning up in front, like Italian
shoes of the fourteenth century, and as time
went on were turned up at the side (having at
first only consisted of a flat sole) and assumed
more the shape of moccasins or regular slippers
and shoes.</p>

<p>With her extensive wig, skimp linen robe, and
bare feet or turned up sandals, the lady of long
ago seems to us a curious figure. The Egyptians,
to use modern slang, were extremely fond of
“sitting upon people,” tables and chairs were upheld
by the forms of carven captives and even
the royal lady’s dainty foot sometimes pressed the
painted image of a slave, as the soles were occasionally
lined with cloth and so decorated. Specimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of the papyrus sandals may be seen in
many museums, among them Berlin, the Salt collection
at Alnwick Castle, the New York Historical
Society and other places.</p>

<p>With Cleopatra, Mary Stuart and such world-wide
charmers ranks perhaps this celebrated
beauty of the earliest times. Of her ancestry we
know nothing. Fair hair, rosy cheeks and light
complexion seem scarcely to suggest the Egyptian
type; yet there is mention made of an occasional
instance of fair hair, and the complexions
were often a clear, light yellow, growing darker
as one went southward. So as a blonde, high-spirited,
bewitching, beautiful and vengeful,
Nitocris stands before us. Nit-a-ker, “the perfect
Nit,” as she is styled in the much injured
“Book of the Kings” in the Turin papyrus, where
some say two of this name are mentioned. A
great contrast we feel her to be, in appearance
at least, to Queen Mertytefs; yet both were able
women who left their mark on their generation.
Like others her name is variously rendered as
Nitocris—the best known appellation—Nitokris,
the former from the Greek Nitaquert, (Egyptian)
Neit-go-ri, or Neit-a-cri.</p>

<p>Her chief claim to remembrance lies in the
building of a third pyramid, or more accurately
the re-building of one, that of Mankaura or
Mencheres. Says Rawlinson, “If Nitocris is
really to be regarded as the finisher of the edifice,
she must be considered a great queen, one of the
few who have left their mark upon the world by
the construction of a really great monument.”</p>

<p>She placed a most beautiful casement, or revetement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of Syenitic granite upon the unfinished
pyramid of Men-kau-ra, begun a thousand years
before, and so important was her part that the
whole erection has been sometimes credited to
her. She perhaps left the body of Men-kau-ra in
a lower chamber, and ordered her own, in a blue
basalt sarcophagus, to be placed above. The fine
basalt sarcophagus found in this pyramid is said
to be hers.</p>

<p>Part of that of Men-kau-ra which was being
carried off to England, was lost in a vessel
wrecked near Gibraltar. The cover of the sarcophagus,
with a prayer to Osiris upon it, is in
the British Museum. It reads “O Osiris who
has become king of Egypt. Majesty living eternally,
child of Olympus, son of Urania. Heir
of Kronos, over thee may she stretch herself, and
cover thee, thy divine mother, Urania, in her
name as Mistress of heaven. May she grant that
thou should’st be like God, free from all evils.
King Majesty, living eternally.” The attenuated
remains of Men-kau-ra have been placed in one
of the museums and the picture taken of them is
in all the collections of Egyptian kings, seeming
to verify the truth that “man is but a shadow.”
There is a story that the mummy or a wood-gilt
image of the daughter of Men-ka-ra was placed
in the figure of a cow in a funeral chamber in
Sais.</p>

<p>The cartouche of Queen Nitocris, with its encircling
arabesque, stands beside that of her husband,
in the long list of Manetho. His name is
given as Nefer-ka-ra, and as Me-tes-ou-phis II,
the question whether he was her brother or not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
remains unsettled. On the king’s death the
queen succeeded as a matter of course, but either
her husband or another brother was murdered,
probably by political adversaries, and her death
followed as a result of his. If it was her husband
that she avenged the desire for the destruction
of his enemies long smouldered in her breast.
She built a hall of great dimensions and doubtless
beauty, below the level of the Nile and invited
the murderers to a feast within its walls.
To disguise her purpose and lull suspicions must
have taxed all her powers and fascinations. Fish,
beef, kids, gazelles, geese, pasties, condiments and
sweets of all sorts loaded the table. The guests
sat, rather than reclined, as in many Eastern
countries, at the board. Beer is said to be as old
as the Fourth Dynasty and that and palm wine
probably flowed freely. As at the present day
paste of almonds may have been mixed with the
Nile water to purify it, and wine and water stood
in porous jars, cooling by the process of evaporation,
an attendant slave fanning the vessels to
hasten the effect. Flowers decorated everything,
hung in garlands and wreathed about the table,
the water jars, and the persons of the guests.</p>

<p>Darkness quickly follows daylight in Egypt,
but it was probably at night that the feast occurred.
Music accompanied the festival, harps,
flutes and other instruments and dancing girls
and jugglers added entertainment and zest to the
passing hour. Then, with a warning which was
little suspected, a small painted and gilded image
of a mummy was carried round among the mirthful
crowd. Says Plutarch, “The skeleton which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the Egyptians appropriately introduce at their
banquets, exhorting the guests to remember that
they shall soon be like him, though he comes as
an unwelcome and unseasonable boon-companion,
is nevertheless, in a certain sense, seasonable, if
he exhorts them not to drink and indulge in
pleasure, but to cultivate mutual friendship and
affection, and not to render life, which is short
in duration, long, by evil deeds.”</p>

<p>Possibly Nitocris shared the feast, beautiful
and gracious, resplendent in jewels and glowing
with the fire of an intense internal and suppressed
excitement, such as a man may feel when he goes
into battle. Not one moment did she repent of
her fearful scheme though she may well have
foreseen that she herself would probably fall a victim.
Possibly she shared the feast and left them
to their revels, or her position as queen may have
made it derogatory to her dignity to be present,
but by her orders the waters of the great river
were let in upon them and they were drowned.
Many lives perhaps for one.</p>

<p>But they were probably powerful nobles, with
families and numerous adherents and the queen
feared the consequences of her act and preferred
to take her own life than trust to the mercy of
their avengers. She is said to have smothered
herself with the fumes of ashes, a noble form of
self-destruction or so considered, like the Japanese
hari-kari, but as this was a Persian custom the
story may belong to that period.</p>

<p>So ended the career of this beautiful and celebrated
queen, called “the Minerva Vietrix” of
her time, “Neith the victorious,” and it is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
inferred that the Sixth Dynasty closed with a
period of convulsions. The Arabs believe that
the queen still haunts (a sort of Lorelei) the vicinity
of her pyramid, in the form of a naked
woman, of such beauty that all men who see her
must needs fall in love with her and lose their
wits. Avenger, murderer, suicide, syren—all
these characters are attributed to her, but it is
the image rather of the fair, innocent, rosy-cheeked,
beautiful young queen that the centuries
have crystallized and preserved for us.</p>

<p>Memphis had in previous reigns been the
greatest city in Egypt, but now others contested
its claim, nevertheless it seems likely that it was
the scene of Queen Nitocris’ tragic fate. Some
one has described Egypt as a green belt, four
miles wide, the Nile like a silver band, and the
cities on its borders like precious stones, and the
river swept on, as Leigh Hunt expressed it, “like
a great purpose threading a dream,” swept silently
by, the giver of life and of death, the god
beloved, worshipped and adored, while the beautiful
queen died and was buried, and the city
waned in prominence and power, and a new
metropolis grew in strength and magnificence
and new dynasties lorded it over the land.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_5">CHAPTER FIFTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">SEBEK-NEFRU-RA.</span></h2>

<p>Spirit seems to have especially distinguished
those queens who have made their way up
through the mists of oblivion which lie so heavily
and darkly over many centuries of the Egyptian
chronology. No vast library remains for us to
turn to and in direct sequence acquaint ourselves
with the early history of this land and people.
Broken monuments and tombs and half obliterated
fragments of papyrus alone tell the story.</p>

<p>Hence from the Sixth to the Twelfth Dynasty,
during which period these sources of information
are notably lacking, no queen’s name appears.
One authority says that the register of
the queen’s expenses for servants, etc., in the
Eleventh Dynasty, has been found, but no special
name seems to be connected with the list; and
our knowledge of this time is very meagre. An
embalmed figure of the Lady Ament, priestess of
Hathor, the Egyptian Venus, has been credited
to the Eleventh Dynasty. She is robed in tissues
as fine as lawn, with sandals in wood and leather
fastened on by worked bands. She wears a woven
collar of pearls, in glass, gold and silver, and has
silver rings on her hands. Silver being then
scarcer than gold was esteemed even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
highly. This Eleventh Dynasty was of the Entef
line, and, says Miss Edwards: “A mummy case
of the Eleventh Dynasty differs as much from
the mummy case of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty as
the recumbent effigy of a crusader in chain-mail
differs from the periwigged memorial statue of
the Queen Anne period.”</p>

<p>Interesting “finds” of this same dynasty are
well preserved wooden boats which had been
used for the transportation of the dead and were
exhumed from the sand. Some are in the
Museum of Cairo, some have been bought for
the collection in our own Chicago, and more from
this region are doubtless to be seen in various
museums, gathered from the Dahshour pyramids
and other places.</p>

<p>With the Twelfth Dynasty Egypt seemed to
wake to a new life in many respects and the arts,
which had deteriorated and languished, again
flourished. Says one traveller, surveying the remains
of this and other famous epochs, “Egypt
has given me a new insight into that vital beauty
which is the soul of true art.” Another, speaking
of the special sculpture of this time, writes “This
school represents the heroic age of Egyptian
sculpture. It lacks the startling naturalism of
the school of the Pyramid period, it never aspired
to the great scale of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth
Dynasties, but it excels all in monumental
majesty, and not only the artist’s work, but the
craftsman’s skill is seen at its best during this
age. No details are so finely cut, no surfaces
glow with so lustrous and indescribable a polish
as those wrought by the lapidaries of the Twelfth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and Thirteenth Dynasties. They finished their
colossi as fastidiously as a gem engraver finished
a cameo. They even polished the sunk surfaces
of their hieroglyphics in incuse inscriptions.” In
short, “they worked like Titans and polished like
jewellers.”</p>

<p>The monarchs of this generation, a noted race,
gained new territory, and in various ways sought
to improve the internal condition of their kingdom
as well, while life, to the favored, became
more luxurious.</p>

<p>There are those who hold the opinion that the
divisions of the dynasties are in some way connected
with the reigns of the queens. Had that
of Nitocris immediately preceded that of Sebek-nefru-Ra,
the fact that both the Sixth and
Twelfth ended with a queen might have given
some color to the idea, but there do not seem
sufficient data to warrant any such conclusion.</p>

<p>Ancient Egyptian history has been divided by
some into three periods, the Old, the Middle, and
the New Empire, while others merely divide into
the Old and the New, including the Middle with
the first. By the former classification the Fourth,
Fifth and Sixth Dynasties are included under the
Old Empire, the Twelfth and Thirteenth under
the Middle and the Eighteenth, Nineteenth and
Twentieth under the New. So that our course of
investigation has now reached the Middle period.
Of the previous and subsequent dynasties, those
for some time before and after the Twelfth the
absence of monumental and other relics leave the
history almost a blank. The Twelfth is said to
have lasted over two hundred years and later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Egyptians looked back to it as a period of National
glory when they were governed by wise
rulers, literature and art flourished and the
language of the time was regarded as a standard
of good writing.</p>

<p>Says a writer in “Monumental Records”:
“Thanks to the effects of M. de Morgan and his
co-workers in the Nile valley we know much
more about Egypt and that wonderful Twelfth
Dynasty, which flourished so many centuries before
Christ, than we do of the history of England’s
kings up to the time of Alfred the Great.
The Egyptian Empire through all its dynasties,
certainly up to the Twelfth, on which the labors
of M. de Morgan at Dahshour throw so much
light, consisted of three estates, the Monarch, the
Army and the Church. As the king’s authority
came through the gods his will was, in theory,
absolute and his spoken or written desires became
laws; but in fact his education from the cradle
was directed and his whole reign dominated by
the power of a well-organized, patriotic priesthood.
The army was made up of the farmers and
workers, every soldier being granted about eight
acres of land for his family which he could commute
at his wish, the physical training of the individual
was scientific and the tactics suited to
the warlike weapons of the age arouse the admiration
and amazement of the foremost soldiers of
our own time. But the priests were the power
behind the throne, and before the people, and,
as a rule, this power was wisely used. The
priests established schools near the temples, they
founded and fostered engineering and the mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
arts; they wrote books; they encouraged
the fine arts; and with the growth of wealth they
sought to restrain the corrupting influences of
luxury.”</p>

<p>The same writer also draws attention to the
fact that in the mural paintings which tell us so
much of the daily lives of the people the high
esteem in which women were held is to be everywhere
noted.</p>

<p>Dynasty Twelfth began with Amenemhat I of
the Theban line which now ruled all Egypt and
of which the red granite temple, whose remains
have been found at Tanis, has been called a family
portrait gallery. The type shown in a fine,
though of course mutilated statue of this king, to
this day characterizes Upper Egypt. He wears
the tall head-dress of Osiris and is described as
having “a large smiling face, thick lips, short
nose and big staring eyes,” with a benevolent,
gentle expression. Miss Edwards gives further
particulars, “The cheek bones are high, the eyes
prominent and heavy lidded, the nostril open;
the lips full, smiling and defined by a slight ridge
at the edges; the frontal bone is wide and the
chin small and shapely.” The statue was found
in the ruins of Tanis and many relics from there
are in the museum at Turin. There is also a head
of Usertesen bearing resemblance to the former,
but less attractive, though equally smiling and
amiable in expression. In later times Rameses,
the Great, but also the Despoiler, cut his own inscriptions
on these and other statues and ruthlessly
appropriated the material of older temples
to carry out his own architectural plans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The museum of the London Universary possesses
the blue lettered portal of the tomb of
Amenemhat, son of Hor-ho-tep and his mother
Erdus. Near Silsileh is a tablet on which we see
a queen behind Neb-kher-ra and we read of “The
royal mother his beloved Aah,” of the Eleventh
or Twelfth Dynasty. A certain queen, Mentu-hotep,
is known by her coffin and toilette box
and there is a copy of an inscription, now destroyed,
which reads “Great royal wife Mentu-hotep,
begotten of the vizier the keeper of the
palace, Semb-hena-f, born of the heiress Sebek-hotep.”
So that this royal lady was not of foreign
lineage, but probably of princely blood by
the mother’s side. A certain Prince Heru-nefer
is mentioned as the son of King Menhotep and
the “great royal wife,” Shertsat; while at Kha-taneh
we find record of Queen Sent, heiress, royal
wife and royal mother. Almost empty names
which give to their bearers but little individuality.</p>

<p>Amenemhat I associated with him as co-regent
his son Ousertesen, or Usertesen I, as in after
years his descendant Thothmes I did his daughter
Hatasu, and Usestesen succeeded his father.
For this son, apparently much beloved, Amenemhat
wrote a series of “Instructions” which have
been preserved and form an interesting page in
the history of the time. We are reminded of
Lord Chesterfield’s Letters to his son, though the
former deal with different subjects than manners
and deportment, and Usertesen was an abler man
and better repaid his father’s interest than did
the youthful Chesterfield. This treatise contained
the usual self-glorifying records. “I conquered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the Ethiopians. I led the Lybians. I
made the Asiatics run before me like greyhounds.”</p>

<p>From the pictures in the grottoes of Benee or
Beni Hasan, by the Arabs called “Stahl Haman,
Pigion Stable,” which are sixty feet square and
forty high, impressive ruins, we view the plain
of Siout and gain much of our knowledge of
these times. They were rock tombs in the face
of the mountain above the level of the Nile, containing
memorials of a series of ministers of
State to the early monarchs of this race, perhaps
favored and appreciated as U’na of the Sixth
Dynasty. The power of the nobles seems to have
been greater, the kings less autocratic than at an
earlier period.</p>

<p>Palms, sycamores, fragrant acasias, mimosas
and acanthus grow around Siout and the air is
fragrant with the rich odor of flowers. Bayard
Taylor thus describes the view of the plain of
Siout viewed from these grotto tombs. “Seen
through the entrance it has a magical effect.
From the grey twilight of the hall in which you
stand, the green of the fields, the purple of the
distant mountains and the blue of the sky dazzle
your eyes as if tinged with the broken rays of a
prism.”</p>

<p>Of Amenemhat’s wife and Usertesen’s mother
there seems no trace. Usertisen I had a brilliant
reign, to which the obelisk remaining at Heliopolis,
the fragments of statues at Tanis and the inscriptions
in the Sienaitic peninsula bear witness—some
of these last are in the Naples museum.
It is a curious detail that at the obelisk of Heliopolis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
it is said that the inscriptions on three sides,
deeply cut, are almost obliterated by the cells of
bees, which have made nests in the hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>A great father was succeeded by a lesser son
in Amenemhat II, of whose wife there is little
or no record. His son, Usertesen II, was the
builder of the pyramid of Illahun, where comparatively
recent discoveries, those of M. de Morgan
in 1892-3-4 have brought to light various remains
of this period and the belongings of the
sisters, wives and daughters of the Amenemhats
and Usertesens. Tombs, robbed and despoiled in
the time of the Hyksos and the Eighteenth
Dynasty, yet yielded to the more careful research
of later explorations hidden treasures, workmen’s
tools of various sorts, and the ornaments, etc., of
these long ago queens and princesses. This is
often of the finest quality and equals if not excels,
in the skill of the craftsman, that earlier discovered
elsewhere, belonging to the Eighteenth
Dynasty.</p>

<p>Usertesen II had a wife named Nofrit or
Nefert. The Gizeh museum has a statue of her,
in granite, in the general character of the sculpture
of the Tanite school. It goes almost without
saying that it is mutilated, the eyes formerly inlaid,
have fallen out, the bronze eyelids are lost,
the arms have disappeared, but enough remains
to show a young and beautiful woman, the fine
outlines of whose youthful form are seen through
the usual narrow linen robe. The head is
adorned, or disfigured, with the heavy wig worn
by the goddess Hathor, the Egyptian Venus, of
which two enormous tresses surround the cheeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and curl outward on the breasts. The queen also
wears on her bosom a pectoral or ornament bearing
the name of her husband. Her titles are
“Hereditary princess,” perhaps the daughter of
the former king, “the great favorite, the highly
praised, the beloved consort of the king, the ruler
of all women, the king’s daughter of his body,
Nefert.” The title ruler or princess is peculiar
and suggests some prerogative of the government
of the female half of the population. Maspero
believes that a statue of this same queen may be
found in the collection now in Marseilles.</p>

<p>Usertesen II and Queen Nefert seem to have
been blessed with a number of children and various
daughters’ names are given, Atmu-neferu,
Sat-hathor and Sent-s-senb. In the subterranean
chamber at Dashur or Dahshour, in the pyramid
of Illahur, the tomb of Usertesen II, before referred
to, was found a chest for Canopic jars
and vases for perfumes, dishes of fowl, wheat
grains, a table for writing, a white swan carved
in wood, canes and jewelry, crowns, diadems and
a gold vulture. The aperture in the ceiling above
beings closed by a stone had escaped the notice of
the earlier depredators whose purpose was in no
way the cause of science. Contrary to the usage
of the Old Empire, but in conformity with that
of the Twelfth Dynasty, these sepulchral chambers
do not contain the carved names of the sovereign
proprietors, but these are learned from
texts on the wooden coffins and on vases. We
have the tombs of the Princess Iza and Knumit,
the tomb of Prince Khuma-Nub and the tombs
of the Princess Sit-hat and Ita-Qurt, “issues of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
royal blood” of the family of Amenhotep II. Of
the Amenemhats we have a list of the sisters,
wives and daughters, Queen Sonit, of whom
there is a statuette in black granite, Nofirhonit,
Soubit, Sithathor and Monit, names only of
whose private history nothing remains to us.</p>

<p>The Princesses Knumit and Iza left much jewelry;
the former, probably the daughter of Amenemhat
II, was evidently the more important person,
with the richer treasures. Among the rest
a large necklace with beads of silver, gold, carnelian,
emerald, lapis-lazuli and hieroglyphic
signs in gold, crusted with precious stones. These
were in sheathing of painted and gilded paste,
through which some of the network and jewels
had escaped. There was also a crown of lotus
flowers, of jewelry, which was so arranged that
the wearer could place in it various plumes or
feathers, to be changed at pleasure.</p>

<p>Henut-tani was the queen of Usertesen III,
the conqueror of Nubia, and she was called queen
consort, but not royal mother. Queen Merseker
and Queen Haankn’s are also mentioned as
queens of the Usertesens. And the queens and
princesses were frequently priestesses to Nit or
Hathor.</p>

<p>The temple of Kounah built by Amenhotep III
is said to have contained 700 statues of the lion-headed
goddess Seckmet, but they were rather
the work of the artisan than the artist and far below
the level of the sculpture of this period.
There is a bust of Amenemhat III at St. Petersburgh.
His reign was distinguished by the construction
of Lake Moeris, an artificial reservoir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of which traces yet remain, and of the great
Labyrinth whose purpose has not been made
clear, but the ruins of which were discovered by
Dr. Lepsius, in the Prussian Expedition to
Egypt. Lake Moeris, with its network of canals,
made all the land of the flat basin of the Fayum
a fertile garden and the fisheries of the lake were
of great value and formed part of the revenues
of the queen.</p>

<p>It was a period of wealth and luxury. All the
furniture, rosewood from India, ebony from the
far south, cedar from the slopes of Lebanon, and
pine from Syria was exquisitely carved. The
walls were frescoed and painted, decorated with
vases for flowers and perfumes and with an altar
for unburnt offerings, and the rooms were in
suites of chambers, sitting rooms, and bath. The
roof was flat, generally shaded with awning, and
hosts and guests could sit or lie upon it and enjoy
the air and the view.</p>

<p>“The opulent Egyptian,” says Monumental
Records, “of the time of Amenemhat II had his
country seat, like our modern prince. Its high-walled
garden was watered by a canal leading
from the Nile. Along the sides of this canal were
walks shaded by the yellow blossomed acacia, the
sycamore and the Theban palm. In the centre of
the garden was a vineyard, the branches trained
over trellis work and so forming a rustic boudoir,
with broad green leaves and clusters of red
grapes on the walls. At one end of the garden
stood a summer house or kiosk; in front of this
was a pond covered with broad leaves and blue
flowers of the lotus, through which water fowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sported. This pond was stocked with fish and
the host invited his guest to join him in spearing
or angling. Adjoining this were the stables and
coach houses, with a park near by, in which gazelles
were bred for coursing—for the gentry of
old Egypt were lovers of the chase. In hunting
wild ducks they made use of decoys and trained
cats to retrieve. They speared hippopotami in
the Nile and hunted lions in the desert with dogs.
They were pigeon-fanciers and were proud of
rare varieties.” In short one is “amazed to see
in studying their social enjoyments their resemblance
to our own.”</p>

<p>The goddess Bast in the time of the ancient
Empire was represented with the head of a
lioness and only in the Twelfth with that of a
cat. The cat and Dongalese dog were first represented
on the walls of Beni-Hasan in the time
of the raids of the kings into Kush or Ethiopia,
the Usertesens and Amenemhats. There are cat
cemeteries belonging to this time where the
skulls are larger than those of our common cats
and also where the animals had been cremated,
while in Upper Egypt, in the Fayum, they were
found mummified and bandaged.</p>

<p>This dynasty closes, as did the Sixth, with a
queen. Little as we know of her she was a ruling
monarch and gives her name to this chapter, as
she appears to have been the only one of this
race who actually swayed the sceptre in her own
right. She was the daughter of Amenemhat III
and probably sister and wife of Amenemhat IV,
whom she succeeded. As her name takes precedence
of his on the monuments they probably did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
not have the same mother and hers may have
been of higher lineage than his. Queen Sebek-nefru-ra,
or Sorknofrituri, is known chiefly from
the traces of her short reign found near Illahun,
fragments of pillars bearing her name beside the
pre-nomen of her father. These or some portion
of them are to be seen in the British Museum.
According to the Turin papyrus she
reigned three years, eight months and eighteen
days, but no tradition has come down to us of her
appearance or personality and no romance or
tragic story of her life or fate.</p>

<p>Amenemhat III had also another daughter,
Phat-neferu, who probably died before her sister
and was buried beside her father. Memorials of
her are an alabaster altar, a block of black granite,
with names and titles and a broken dish, inscribed
“King’s daughter, Ptah-neferu.” A
sphinx of grey granite is thought to be Queen
Sebek-nefrura, because different from the others,
which is of course not very conclusive proof and
at Hawara her name occurs as often as that of
her father on columns and blocks, and there is a
cylinder of white schist, glazed blue, of unusual
size and bearing all her titles, also a scarab. But
it is but little after all that we know of her.</p>

<p>A romance has been discovered of this dynasty
in the earlier period, in a story of which a beginning
is found on a piece of broken limestone,
the end of the tale having been for some time
previously preserved on a papyrus in the Berlin
Museum. Probably it was a favorite piece of literature,
like the adventures of Robinson Crusoe
to the English speaking world, and might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
been found in various forms. A certain Senebat,
an Egyptian, having overheard a state secret and
fearing that if this were discovered his life might
pay the forfeit, fled to Syria. Wandering in the
desert and almost dying of thirst he was found by
some of the wild tribes, saved and adopted by
them and in time rose to the rank of chief. But
homesickness at last overtook him and he sent an
appeal to the Egyptian king for permission to return.
He was then invited to court, where he
wrote a curious account of his adventures and
the manners and customs of the Bedouins. He
was much honored, being received by the queen
and family while the royal daughters performed
a dance and sang a chorus of praise to the king.
The monarch even distinguished him by taking
an interest in the tomb which he prepared and at
the end of a sort of triumphal song, Senebat,
says, “I was in favor with the king to the day
of his death.”</p>

<p>The Twelfth Dynasty is also interesting to us
as being contemporaneous with the birth of the
Jewish nation, the time of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob.</p>

<p>A stele bears the names of the daughters or
aunts of the deceased king Sebek-hotep II adoring
Min, and their names are Anhetabu and
Anget-dudu, born of Queen Nen-na. The parents
of Sebek-hotep II are spoken of as “the
divine father Men-tuhotep III” and royal mother,
Anhet-abu, after whom evidently one of the
daughters or grand-daughters was called. The
name Sebek-hotep was a favorite. The father of
Nefer-hotep and Sebek-hotep III was Ha’ankh’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
his mother Kema, his wife Sebsen and he had
four royal children. A statement of facts probably,
but with little accompanying detail. Sebek-hotep
IV had for his queen Nub-em-hat and his
daughter was Sebek-emhat, and there is a certain
Pernub, probably of this family, descended
from Queen Ha’ankh’s.</p>

<p>Queen Nub’kha’s was the wife of Sebek-em-saf,
whose tomb was among those discovered in
1881. It was first rifled in the Twentieth
Dynasty and is referred to in papyrus of the time
of Rameses IX, of which the Amherst and Abbott
papyrus give accounts. Like so many of the
queens our only knowledge of her is from her
tomb and that from the deposition of the robber
who violated it, which is thus given. “It (the
tomb) was surrounded by masonry and covered
with roofing stone. We demolished it and found
them (the king and queen) reposing therein. We
found the august king with his divine axe beside
him and his amulets and ornaments of gold about
his neck. His head was covered with gold and
his august person was entirely adorned with gold.
His coffins were overlaid with gold and silver
within and without and incrusted with all kinds
of precious stones. We took the gold which we
found upon the sacred person of this god, as also
his amulets and the ornaments which were about
his neck and the coffins in which he reposed. And
having found the royal wife we took all that we
found upon her, in the same manner and we set
fire to their mummy cases and we seized upon
the furniture, their vases of gold and silver and
bronze, and we divided them among ourselves.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Death was deservedly the penalty for such offences,
but probably the sinner felt a certain relief
in making a “clean breast” of it, or perhaps
fancied in some strange way that his wicked exploit
conferred a sort of distinction upon him.</p>

<p>A stele gives the genealogy of this queen as
daughter of the chief of the judges Sebek-dudu,
who, rich or poor man, had four wives. The
queen is called on a stele in the Louvre “great
heiress the greatly favored, the ruler of all
women, united to the crown,” thus showing that
the kings did not always marry princesses. In
the Fourteenth Dynasty, up to this writing, no
queen’s name has been discovered. Weaker
rulers followed, and thus Asiatic invaders, the
Hyksos, an alien race, mistakenly supposed by
Josephus to be Hebrews, were able to overpower
and usurp the government, ruling in some places
simultaneously with, and in others expelling the
native sovereigns. They were called shepherd
kings or princes. Some of their statues remain,
but as they were frequently re-inscribed by later
kings, there is doubt about some of them. All
traces of the queens are, so far, lost during this
period. Whether these strange invaders kept
their women in the seclusion usual in the East or
whether once existing relics have been destroyed,
we know not. Beside the few portrait statues of
the kings no royal consort appears, and they are
of a different style of art. Joseph is thought to
have been the prime minister of one of the
Hyksos rulers and an inscription found which
reads: “A famine having broken out during
many years I gave corn to the towns during each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
famine,” is believed by some to relate to him. But
it was not the wont of the Egyptian monarchs to
celebrate the achievements of their slaves and
such early memorials, if existing, would probably
have been destroyed when the Hebrew race was
enslaved by their oppressors.</p>

<p>Petrie gives the approximate dates of 2821
B. C. to 1928 B. C. for these various reigns.</p>

<span class="smaller">AAH-HOTEP.</span></h2>

<p>Between the Fourteenth Dynasty, of which we
last spoke, and the Seventeenth and Eighteenth
Dynasties, to which this chapter brings us, occurs
the third chasm in the monuments, and as they
are the chief dependence in learning the history
of Egypt, the information in regard to this intervening
period is very meagre. Egypt was ruled
with special favor shown to the central portion,
and weaker monarchs had succeeded the great
Amenemhats and Usertesens. Foreigners, the
so-called Hyksos, or Shepherd Kings, overran
and took possession of the country and conquered
it, almost without battles, proceeding later to destroy
the temples and kill the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Among these kings’ names are that of Salatis,
or Shaloti, and a certain Apepi, of the Turanian
type, a bust of whom is in the British Museum,
and another at Gizeh, while it is to one of these
rulers that Joseph is by some believed to have
been the favored minister, but, as has been said
before, no queen appears amongst them.</p>

<p>After the lapse of five hundred years Egypt
awoke from its partial lethargy and, throwing off
the yoke of these invaders, asserted its independence
under a line of native rulers. Battles were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
fought and won, and the Theban princes again
held sway. King Ta’a ruled, perhaps tributary
to the Hyksos, revolted and partially liberated
himself from thral, but it remained to his descendant
Aahmes to completely accomplish this
object. It seemed somewhat characteristic of the
Egyptian monarchs that they did not know how
to hold their conquered territory. Again and
again they won battles and subjected foreign peoples
only to lose what they had gained, to be
once more fought for by their warlike successors.</p>

<p>The divisions into dynasties is said not to have
been made by the Egyptians themselves, but to
have been used by historians for the greater convenience
of indicating the families who, together
or in succession, held the sceptre.</p>

<p>No woman’s strength had been able to struggle
up through the previous oblivion, but she now
once more takes her place beside the king and
shares with him honors, both divine and human.
“Divine spouse,” a term not used before, is applied
to the queens of this era, who were regarded
as the mothers of the race and worshipped for
generations after.</p>

<p>It was sometimes inscribed on the monuments
in Egypt that “the sons of Misr” were all born
equal, but this had about the same relation to
facts that the vaunted “Liberty, Equality and
Fraternity” sometimes bore. In the Twelfth Dynasty,
below the crown and royal family came,
first, the class of priests; second, the soldiers;
third, the husbandmen, gardeners, huntsmen and
boatmen; fourth, tradesmen, shopkeepers, artificers
in stone and metal, boat builders, stone masons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and public weighers; fifth, shepherds, poulterers,
fishermen, fowlers, laborers and the people
at large—distinctly a succession of classes.
Laborers wore only an apron and short trousers
of coarse woven grass cloth.</p>

<p>The times were changing; this we learn from
the numerous remains of this period, on the
sculptured and painted monuments and the papyri,
of which many have been discovered. The
temples were growing in importance and the
kings were buried more in grottoes than, as formerly,
in monuments. The military man succeeded
the farmer, and the priests gained in
power. The wall paintings give pictures of festivals,
with music and dancing, and less of the
agricultural life previously so much dwelt upon.</p>

<p>It is interesting to know that the horse, in so
many countries the useful and often beloved companion
of man, seems to have been first introduced
into Egypt in the Eighteenth Dynasty.
After that he often figures in battles, and draws
the state chariot in which both kings and queens
take their pleasure. On the wall of a tomb at
Thebes, that of a certain Hui of the Eighteenth
Dynasty, is the picture of a queen drawn by two
piebald bulls, like the modern Abyssinian breed.
This, presumably, is just before the period when
horses were in general use. To this time is also
attributed the introduction of the pomegranate,
the beautiful Eastern fruit of which poets have
often sung; and earrings were then said to be
added to the previous list of adornments, as the
result of foreign example—they first took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
shape of broad disks, and later, under the Twentieth
Dynasty, became large rings.</p>

<p>In the Seventeenth Dynasty we have mention
of a Queen Ansera. Of her private history we
know nothing, but after her death she extended
her hospitality to a number of her royal connections,
for the great discovery in the summer of
1881 brought to light the mummies of many
kings and queens gathered together in her tomb.
Among these were the celebrated King Rameses
II, by some thought to be the oppressor of the
Israelites; Queen Aahmes-Nefertari, first of the
Eighteenth Dynasty; Queen Merit-Amen, Queen
Hout-timoo-hoo and Queen Sitka, also belonging
to this dynasty, besides others of later date.</p>

<p>A certain confusion for a long time existed between
the two queens, Aah-hotep and Aahmes-Nefertari,
but the late history of Professors Petrie
and Mahaffy has rendered the details of this
period somewhat clearer. Different authorities
have varied the name and spelling of Queen Aah-hotep.
Thus we have in addition to the spelling
above given, Aahotep, Aah-hetep or Ahhot-pou.
It has the pretty meaning, “gift of the moon,”
and she seems to have been a Theban princess, and
first to have married an Egyptian, perhaps not of
royal rank, and then Seqenenra, whose mummy
has been found, showing that he had been
wounded in battle. He was of the Berber type—tall,
slender and vigorous, with small, long head
and fine black hair. The reasons for this chronology
are said not to be very strong. Aahmes
was perhaps son of the first, Nefertari, daughter
of the second, so the lawful heir, and Aahmes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
thus married his half-sister. If Kames, at first
thought to be the husband and later the son of
Queen Aah-hotep, was the elder brother, he had
a short reign, followed by Aahmes and Nefertari.</p>

<p>Queen Aah-hotep had several children and was
a wonderful woman, according to some accounts,
with the longevity of a Mertytefs. A Theban
stele of Kames shows that in the tenth year of
Amen-hotep I, that Aah-hotep, the royal mother,
was still active, revered and honored, taking a
share in the government and perhaps regent in
the absence of the king, at eighty-eight years of
age, and she seems still to have been alive during
the reign of Tahutmes or Thothmes I. Hence
she had seen the whole of the revolution which
again set the native princes upon the throne,
during the reigns of son, grandson and great
grandson. Petrie says of her, she was “one of
the great queens of Egyptian history, important
as the historic link of the dynasties and revered
along with her still more celebrated and honored
daughter, Nefertari.” Peculiarly close, and perhaps
personally tender, relations seem to have
existed between these two, who were both mother
and daughter and mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.
And children and grandchildren appear
to have paid highest respect to Queen Aah-hotep.</p>

<p>The esteem of the son for his mother in the
time of the Old Empire seems to have been great,
as the Frenchman of to-day is said to be especially
devoted to his. The family groups representing
the living or dead, and sometimes both,
frequently give the king, his wife and his mother,
while the father rarely appears; though this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
probably more apt to be the case when the royal
dignity has descended on the maternal rather
than the paternal side.</p>

<p>Queen Aah-hotep was evidently much beloved
by her martial son and grandsons, for the latter
lavished upon her dead body all sorts of jewelry
and ornaments to be buried with her. This large
collection has been found and preserved, and,
until the discovery of the parure of some of the
princesses of the Twelfth Dynasty, was the finest
specimen of the skill of the Egyptian craftsman
that had come down to modern times. The body
was found in the ancient necropolis of No, buried
only a few feet below the surface. This, of
course, was not the original place of sepulture,
where the latest authorities believe it was placed,
not by the Arab plunderers of the other royal
tombs, but by pious hands, to preserve it from
destruction, in the unsettled state of the country.
Brugsch thus describes it: “The cover of the
coffin had the shape of a mummy and was gilt
above and below. The royal asp decked the brow.
The white of the eye is represented by quartz and
the pupils by black glass. A rich imitation necklace
covers the breast and shoulders; the uræus
serpent and the vulture—the holy symbols of the
Upper and Lower land of Kemi—lie below the
necklace. A closed pair of wings seem to protect
the rest of the body. At the soles of the
feet stand the statues of the mourning goddesses,
Isis and Nepththys. The inscription in the middle
row gives us the queen Aah-hotep, as servant
of the moon.”</p>

<p>The mummy of Queen Aah-hotep was discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
by rummaging Arabs in 1860, but was captured
and confiscated by the authorities, who
opened the coffin and took away what it contained.
The rumor of this theft had spread, and
Mariette, the great Egyptologist, who was in
charge of the museum at Boulak, put his hand on
the coffin and the jewels, but was not able to save
them all. He believed that the queen was not
originally buried where the Arabs discovered her,
but thinks that towards the close of the Twentieth
Dynasty she had been carried off by bands
of robbers, spoken of in the Abbott papyrus, and
hidden by them to despoil at leisure. Their design,
however, was frustrated, as they were probably
caught and executed, and their secret perished
with them, until rediscovered hundreds of
years later. As may be seen, the theories of the
authorities on these subjects differ somewhat, as
is so frequently the case. But to the latest researches
and opinions perhaps should be attached
the greatest weight, since they have the advantage
of their predecessors’ views and the benefit
of the most modern discoveries.</p>

<p>A fine illustration of female clothing and
adornment is given in the standing statue of the
Dame or Lady “Takarshit.” She wears a short
wig, in rows of curls, and an embroidered band
across her head, a very scant, narrow, and short
robe, which almost makes us wonder how she
had free play for her limbs (this, too, is embroidered
in rows with religious subjects), and
she has bracelets and chains on her wrists and
arms. The face is older than the figure, as the
Egyptians in sculpture would occasionally unite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the beauty of youthful form with that of the
more mature head and countenance.</p>

<p>The list of Queen Aah-hotep’s treasures, habited,
as we can picture her to be, in the garb just
described, is a long one. On the gilded coffin lid
she is represented with face uncovered and body
enveloped in wings of Isis. This goddess was a
special object of worship at this time, as later in
the Ptolemaic period also. Among the most interesting
of the trinkets is a little golden boat
set on a wheeled wooden carriage and manned
with small figures, the central one of which is
her son, King Kames, or, as it was originally
thought, her husband. He is going to Abydos,
and holds in his hand an axe and a sceptre.
There is also another little silver boat with its
crew of rowers. A diadem as small as a bracelet
for the wrist was found attached to the head of
the queen, and terminated in tiny sphinxes, with
the name of Aahmes engraved in letters of gold
upon a groundwork of lapis-lazuli. A funeral
collar, prescribed by the ritual, has designs of
animals in chased gold, the figures outlined by
fine gold wires, like Chinese cloissonne, between
paste and colored stones. The coloring of all
this enamel is particularly rich. There are three
massive gold bees, possibly intended as the decoration
for some order; also silver bees. A necklace
with hanging ornaments in the shape of red
and blue almonds. A box in the form of a royal
cartouch as a large seal guarded by two sphinxes.
A magnificent chain with the head of a goose
at either end, the name of King Aahmes on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
neck and the scarabeus or sacred beetle hanging
from it.</p>

<p>Necklaces of gold and silver, rings and bracelets,
the former with little figures of the gods, or
amulets of various sorts hanging from them,
were much worn; and it is said that after the
Twenty-sixth Dynasty, owing to Phoenician influences,
the bracelets usually terminated in
lions’ heads. These amulets were supposed to
preserve the wearer from harm, both in a present
and a future world, and the gods themselves,
strange to say, sought such protection. The “evil
eye,” still thought to exist in our comparatively
modern life, as witness the Salem witchcraft
craze, was especially dreaded, and there were various
designs to ward off its ill effects. Among
these were outstretched fingers; “Ut-a’” eyes,
sometimes with wings and hands, holding a disk,
in different substances; the right symbolized the
king, as the sun, the left, the queen, as the moon,
and, either sculptured or worn, guarded the
owner from this particular form of harm.</p>

<p>The heart amulet and the scarab or scarabeus
was very common. Many curious notions prevailed
about this insect. It was believed to be
of only one sex, and women ate it to induce fecundity.
The fact that the male and female
closely resemble each other and share in the care
of their offspring probably was the foundation of
this idea. A remarkable example of a scarab
was taken from the mummy of Tahut’mes III.
It was of steatite, glazed, of a greenish purple
hue, in a hold frame bound across. There was a
figure of Tahut’mes kneeling, with crown on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
head, and the whip, signifying authority, in his
hand, while with the other he made an offering
to the god. A dog was represented in front and
a hawk behind him, and a gold loop was attached
to hang the scarab to the chain on the neck. All
Egyptians loved jewelry, the men as well as the
women wearing necklaces, collars, etc., of gold,
silver, beads and precious stones. Great use was
made of carnelian, lapis lazuli, jasper, etc., and
ladies would occupy themselves, as do the blind
of our own time, in stringing glass beads and
bugles into network, which in these latter days
is used to trim the clothing of the living, while
with the Egyptian it was chiefly for the adornment
of the dead.</p>

<p>A chapter from the Book of the Dead was
found on a scarab of the time of Mycerinas.
These scarabs seem to have been of three classes;
the first merely for ornament, the second for historic
record, and the third for funeral purposes.
They sometimes bore the names of kings earlier
than those with whose mummies they have been
found. A signet ring was of special importance
and a necessary article among the belongings of
either king or queen, as also of many others of
less elevated rank. It was the same thing as the
signing of a personal name at the present time—they
sealed instead of signing, and when an Eastern
monarch wished to send special orders he
would sometimes intrust his signet ring to the
bearer in token of authority. This ring was of
gold or less valuable material, according to the
rank of the owner. Many examples of a pretty
class of ring made of faience, in blue, green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
purple, etc., and manufactured at Tel-el-Amarna,
the city built by Amen-hotep IV, formerly called
Khu-n-aten, in the latter part of the Eighteenth
Dynasty have been found, and are among the collections
in various museums.</p>

<p>Some of these collections have sets of ornaments
belonging to ancient kings and queens.
Berlin has that of an Ethiopean Candace. The
Louvre that of a Prince Pzar, with griffins and
lotus. Also a ring of Rameses II, with little
horses standing on the bezel. At Gizeh are
heavy earrings of Rameses IX, with filagree
chains and uræus, and bracelets of Pinotem in
gold encrusted with stones, like those made to-day
in the Soudan. The later discoveries of this
sort, belonging to the latter period of the Egyptian
Empire, show Greek influences. But the
most extensive, tasteful and finely wrought of
these objects was the parure of Queen Aah-hotep.
Chains to the women were as essential as
rings to the men; a woman was indeed poor if
her jewel box held only one.</p>

<p>As the North American Indian slays the favorite
horse and lays beside his dead chief bows and
arrows for use in the “happy hunting grounds,”
so the Egyptian placed in the tomb of his revered
and beloved things that he used in daily
life. At one time it was even the custom in the
case of a king to kill some of his slaves, whose
souls might accompany and attend upon him,
but this cruel practice was not kept up. For
service in another existence, food, furniture and
personal belongings surrounded the dead in his
grave, as they had done the living in his household;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and, in the case of a woman especially, all
her feminine appliances for the toilette and many
of her ornaments and jewels were included.
Some were what had belonged to her in the
past, some were newly prepared for the future
state. Even faded flowers hundreds of years old
have been discovered, and fruit has been found
with mummies of the Eleventh Dynasty.</p>

<p>One museum possesses a sarcophagus of a
priest of Maut and a prophet of Queen Aah-hotep.
To her the priests of Amen rendered divine
honors. On the inside of the coffin are invocations
to the divine Amenophis II (a descendant
of the queen’s), and also to both Queens
Aah-hotep and Nefertari Ahmes. The coffin of
the former was not so gigantic as that of the
latter, and somehow one pictures her as rather
smaller and more feminine looking than the
daughter who succeeded her in the royal honors,
with the thick eyelashes blackened with kohl, the
straight brows, the almond-shaped eyes and the
other features characteristic of the Egyptian face.
Into the future life in which the Egyptian believed
so ardently she stepped, after a long pilgrimage
in this world, accompanied by all the
little devices which had made her comfort and
pleasure here, to be honored and revered as she
had been accustomed to be in the lower world.</p>

<p>Among the valued amulets was the buckle,
or “Tie,” made of jasper, carnelian, porphery,
red glass, faience and sycamore wood, more
rarely of gold. The red material stood for the
blood of Isis, and this amulet was put on the
neck of a mummy for its protection. Such were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
usually without inscription, but two found together
would occasionally be inscribed with a
chapter from the Book of the Dead. The “Tet,”
made of gold, sometimes had plumes, when it
signified Osiris and meant firmness. This also
was for protection. Serpents’ heads guarded
from their bites in another world. The vulture
amulet was of gold, but was not common. It referred
to “Mother Isis,” and bore such inscriptions
from the Book of the Dead as “His Mother,
the mighty lady, makes his protection and brings
him to Horus.” This was sometimes suspended
from the usual gold collar worn by the dead. The
“anck,” or life sign, was something like a small
cross with an oval ring on top instead of the
upper arm, and was very frequent. The amulet
“Nefer” was for good luck. “Maut,” always
worn by the god Ptah, was a frequent emblem of
Hathor. Frogs, disks, plumes, etc., were of this
list. Some of these, and more, probably surrounded
Queen Aah-hotep.</p>

<p>In a pectoral on her breast King Ahmes was
represented, while the two divinities Amen and
Ra poured the water of purification on his head;
they stand in a little green temple. Bracelets for
the ankle or upper arm were simple rings of gold,
massive, solid or hollow, edged with threads of
gold to represent filagree. Others worn at the
wrist, like ours, were formed of beads of gold,
lapis lazuli, carnelian and green feldspar, mounted
on threads of gold and disposed in squares in
which half was a different color. The fastenings
were two gold plates united by an aiglet of gold,
the cartouch of Ahmes engraved lightly at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
point. Some of the bracelets were more complicated
but not so fine in workmanship—three
parallel bands garnished with turquoise. There
was also a vulture, the queen’s special ornament,
with outstretched wings; also the heads of sparrow-hawks.
Some of the ornaments were attached
to the cloth in which the mummy was
wrapped by rings. But for what we may call
the trousseau of a bride of the tomb, jewelry was
not sufficient. Arms, with which she was to protect
herself, or be protected, from the evil spirits
of another world, were also provided and placed
with her. There was a unique specimen of a
baton, bent at the extremity and adorned with a
spiral of gold. Such forms as this are found to-day
among the inhabitants of Nubia and the
Soudan, but probably have not the same meaning.
An axe was ornamented with gold and precious
stones, inlaid, and with a picture of the warlike
Aahmes slaying an enemy. Handles of knives in
ebony were carved with the lotus. There were
poinards with female heads, and sheaths with
raised ornaments of damascened gold and inscriptions.
On the blade on one side was “The
beneficent god Ra-neb-pebti, life giver, as the
sun, ever.” On the other, “The son of the sun
and of his side Aahmes-nakht—life giver and
always.” One hatchet had a handle of horn and
a silver blade. A poinard had a yellow bronze
blade and silvered handle, and there was also a
clasp of bronze with holes left for ostrich feathers.</p>

<p>To these were added a large variety of toilette
articles, vases and jars of various sorts for spices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
unguents, etc. Alabaster jars in tombs are as
ancient as the Fourth Dynasty, and examples are
also known inscribed with the name of Unas,
Pepi I, Men-tu-em-saf, Amasis I, Tahutimes II,
Amenophis II, Rameses II, and Queen Amen-eritis.</p>

<p>The god Bes, said to be introduced from Punt,
presided over the toilette. He had a squat, hideous
figure, and a face which was doubtless chiefly
appreciated from its contrast to that of his fair
votaries. He bore a double character, one side
being military or martial in aspect, the other a
sort of Bacchus or god of Pleasure, and it was
in this last, probably, that he was regarded as
a suitable guardian for the preparations for feasts
and revels. Toilette articles, of which a number
were found with the body of the queen, were mirrors,
tweezers, hairpins of wood, bone, ivory and
metal, and occasionally combs of wood and ivory,
though these last are believed by some authorities
not to have been introduced till later. There
were also kohl pots and little tubes and jars of
various forms. Tiny hands of ivory on a stick
for scratching the back were sometimes found.</p>

<p>The mirrors, from three to twelve inches in
diameter, had handles ornamented with flowers,
particularly the well-beloved lotus, and heads of
the goddess Hathor and the god Bes. Vases
and jars found in the tombs were of various
shapes, for wine, oils, spices, unguents, scents,
etc., but transparent glass ones are not found
earlier than the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. The kohl
pots were to hold stibium and antimony of copper
to stain the eyelids and eyebrows and give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the eyes a wide-open appearance; also for such
purposes were little hollow tubes of wood, glass,
ivory and alabaster, a column with a palm leaf
and figures of Bes. Sometimes the tubes were
double, with movable covers on a pivot and accompanied
by a stick of bronze wood to apply
the unguent. The wicked Jezabel in the Bible is
said to have “set her eyes in stibium,” which
was, however, a common Eastern practice.</p>

<p>Fine examples of such articles, with the pre-nomen
of Amenophis III and his wife Tyi, and
of Tut-arch-Amen and his wife Anknes-Amen,
have been found. Hematite pillows or head rests,
generally uninscribed, and papyrus sceptres
mounted in mother-of-emerald and faience, may
perhaps be added to this list and not exhaust it.
Thus was the queen, surrounded by all the paraphernalia
of life, laid in her last resting place.
The Egyptian, as has been before said, spent
much of his time in preparing and providing for
a future existence, and it is through his death, as
it were, and on tombs and monuments that we
attain to any realistic knowledge of his living
days.</p>

<p>The queen is believed to have had a number of
children besides Aahmes and Nefertari, whose
personality stands out pre-eminent among them.
Of these are Birpu, who appears on a statuette,
Amenmes and Uazrmes. Of Nebt’ta, one of
the daughters, a scarab is known. And Mut’nefert,
subsequently queen, may also have been of
this family.</p>

<p>Queen Mertytefs’ name calls up this active,
capable ruling spirit of the household and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
court. Queen Nitocris comes before us as the
beauty of her time—the Mary Stuart of an early
age, lovely, captivating and admired, but not
blameless in her life story. Queen Sebek-nefru-ra
is associated with father and husband in works
of public usefulness and benefit. But Queen Aah-hotep
seems to bear with her an atmosphere of
femininity and tenderness. A devout worshipper
of the gods, we can picture her as a frequent attendant
upon the services and offerings in the
temples. At home, a woman perchance with
some foibles and weaknesses and a truly feminine
love for ornamentation, and yet a mother
who won an undying affection. Lamentations
and mourning doubtless followed her to the
tomb, and upon her inanimate form was lavished
a wealth of adornment which bespoke the clinging
tenderness of the royal son whose name is
found so often inscribed upon her ornaments.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_7">CHAPTER SEVENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">AAHMES-NEFERTARI.</span></h2>

<p>Aahmes, also called Amosis, son of Queen Aah-hotep
and an Egyptian father (whose history is
as yet unknown), was one of the greatest warriors
and most noted kings of Egypt, and regarded
as the savior of his country, since he freed
it from the long thrall of an alien race. Ambition
was evidently a ruling passion with him, but
he appears to have been devoted and even tender
to those he loved. His wife, the Princess Nefertari-Aahmes,
or Aahmes-Nefertari, was long
supposed to be the daughter of an Ethiopian king,
and therefore not of kin to him, since her pictures
on the monuments show a black skin,
though Caucasian features.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Nefertari Aahmes.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Later researches have proved her to be his
half-sister, the daughter of his mother, but not of
his father. She was evidently the first daughter
of Queen Aah-hotep’s marriage with Sequenenra,
and with a more direct title to the succession than
her husband, so that there were state reasons as
well as private ones for the marriage. From
Sequenenra, therefore, he being of the Berber
type, she took her coloring and the right of succession,
and she may perhaps be said to have
been three-quarters black. The name signifies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
“good or beautiful companion,” and she was regarded
with great veneration on earth and shared
with her mother, and mother-in-law, divine honors
after death.</p>

<p>Thebes, which had risen to political consequence
in the time of the Eleventh and Twelfth
Dynasties, was now the royal city, the safest
home of the royal family, and was said to have
stood to Ethiopia, as well as to Egypt, as Rome
did to mediaeval Christendom. It was in Upper
Egypt, the sacred city, and devoted to the worship
of the god Amen, or Amon, whom the
Greeks regarded as their Jove. From here went
out the great war chariots and the bands of soldiers
to battle, and often, especially at this period,
to conquest.</p>

<p>“The chief peculiarity of the Egyptians,” says
a writer who is an authority, “is the remarkable
closeness of their eyelashes on both lids, forming
a dense double fringe, which gives so animated
an expression to their almond-shaped eyes.” The
very ancient and still existing custom of blackening
the edges of the eyelids with antimony
(kohl), which is said to serve a sanitary purpose,
contributes to enhance this natural expression.
The eyebrows are straight and smooth,
never bushy. The mouth is wide and thick-lipped,
and very different from that of the Beduin
or inhabitant of the oases. The high cheek
bones, the receding forehead, the lowness of the
bridge of the nose (this last in some pictures of
the statues of Queen Nefertari-Aahmes being
noticeable), which is always distinctly separated
from the forehead, and the flatness of the nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
itself are the chief characteristics of the Egyptian
skull; but as the jaw projects less than those of
most of the other African colored races, it has
been assumed that the skull is Asiatic and not
African in shape. A headless statue at Karnak
and statuettes at various places exist. They suggest
a queenly bearing, and from these and the
general description we must form our mental
picture of this dark-skinned lady. A light complexion
was much admired, but Queen Nefertari-Aahmes
was of different type, and perhaps set the
fashion of her own style of beauty; at one place
she was painted yellow, and one authority
claimed that she was only black in a mythological
sense, but it now seems to be agreed that to a
Berber father she owed her tint.</p>

<p>The two names, Nefruari and Nefertari, appear
to be interchangeable, and probably bear
the same relation to each other as Mary and
Maria. We can see plainly the difference ’twixt
our Jacks and Johns, our Marys and Marias, but
the alteration of a single letter in a foreign
tongue leaves us somewhat bewildered, and the
Nofruaris and the Nefertaris, the Nefrits and
the Nofrits, etc., are often very puzzling, and, unless
great care is taken, may lead to serious complications
and mistakes.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of this period comes largely
from two sources, the tomb of a naval officer in
the service of Aahmes and the discoveries of
comparatively late years, which have brought to
light many of the very bodies of the kings,
queens and princesses of this and subsequent
lines. Even in death the truth of the proverb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
seems to hold, that “uneasy lies the head that
wears a crown,” and not in what was intended to
be their last resting places, but in collections and
museums, are gathered many royalties whose eyes
looked out on the light of an ancient world.</p>

<p>Aahmes, son of Abuna, directly or indirectly
the king’s namesake, was an officer of the ship
called “The Calf,” and later served on one named
“Ruling in Memphis,” which perhaps celebrated
the reconquering of the ancient capital. Of his
early life there are some amusing records: “I
was too young to have a wife, and slept in the
semt cloth and shennu garment.” This was
about 1586 B. C., and his age perhaps twenty.
Nor, following the example of his sovereigns,
does he hesitate to blow his own trumpet “As
soon as I had a house,” says the martial hero,
“I was taken to a ship called the ‘North’ on account
of my valor.” Apparently, he could face
the enemy early in life, but not a fair lady. Diospolis,
or Thebes, “hundred-gated Thebes,” was
now the chief city, and Officer Aahmes saw active
service, but survived and was rewarded by his
monarch. The chronicle reads: “I brought very
many prisoners. I do not reckon them,” and,
further, that he was “presented with gold seven
times in the face of the whole land.” The story
of his exploits on his tomb throws much light
upon the history of the time.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1881, in a pit, near Thebes,
was found a concourse of mummies, the bodies
of many kings and queens, among them Queen
Nefertari-Aahmes. The existence of royal tombs
had long been suspected from the various articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
which had found their way into the market, and
the authorities were at length able to secure the
Arab who was the chief purloiner. He and his
accomplices long obstinately resisted all inducements,
even that of imprisonment, to reveal their
secret, but finally yielded, and the bodies of various
sovereigns of the Seventeenth, Eighteenth,
Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties (the Twentieth
was missing) were found.</p>

<p>The experienced archeologist can tell from the
appearance of a mummy case to what period it
belongs. The oldest mummy in the world, until
recently, about which there was no doubt, is that
of Saken-em-saf, son of Pepi I, of the Sixth Dynasty.
The mummies of the Eleventh Dynasty
are poorly made, brittle and yellowish; those of
the Twelfth Dynasty are black, and from these
to the Seventeenth are also inferior. But those
of the Eighteenth are so finely embalmed that
the limbs are pliable and bend without breaking.
At Thebes they were generally painted yellow.
Alexander the Great is said to have been buried
in honey, as was the case with others. Bitumen
was used towards the time of the Ptolemies, and
grew hard with age. Later still, pieces of wood
were inserted, with the face painted upon them.</p>

<p>The “Book of the Dead,” so often spoken of,
and whose reputed author was the god Thoth,
was a sort of Bible to the Egyptians, and contained
minute directions in regard to burial rites.
It was written in chapters, and was an accretion,
taking shape gradually, some parts being much
older than others. It was seldom or never collected
in one roll. It is said that a fairly complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
copy was ninety feet long and about fifteen inches
wide. It was written on papyrus; chapters of it
were buried with the dead, and extracts were inscribed
on scarabs and other objects and used
in the same way. The book is a storehouse of information
as regards Egyptian theology and
practice, and translations of it exist in several
languages besides English. Figures like small
mummies and called Ushabti, or Ushebti, “little
servants,” to accompany and attend upon the departed,
were buried with them. This was probably
a survival of the original custom of killing
some of his slaves at the tomb of the master. In
the Thirteenth Dynasty these images were made
of granite or wood; in the Eighteenth of faience,
or made in moulds, and from the Twenty-fourth
to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty they were not much
used, and later were carelessly made. They were
often inscribed with the Sixth chapter from the
Book of the Dead.</p>

<p>The coffins of the Eighteenth Dynasty were
larger than the previous ones, and were shaped
in the form of a mummy, with inscriptions running
from the breast to the feet. Of such colossal
size was that of Queen Nefertari-Aahmes that it
took sixteen men to move it, and it was over
seven metres in height. After the Eighteenth
Dynasty the cases were again smaller. The
queen’s was made of innumerable layers of linen,
saturated and hardened together by some kind of
glue, was painted blue and yellow with a mesh-like
effect, and the features, necklace, bracelets,
etc., picked out in blue. The face, evidently a
portrait, was large and round, with a sweet expression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and she wore an extensive wig, with
the plumes of Amen and Maut. In each hand she
held the royal “ankh,” or life sign, and the helmet
and plumes, also the investiture of Osiris,
were befitting the wife of a warrior and one who
was regarded as a goddess.</p>

<p>There was also the coffin of the Lady Rai,
nurse of Queen Nefertari, in green garnished
with bands of yellow. Within were inscriptions
to the goddess Maut, in honor of Ra, and other
inscriptions with the name of Ra, but the body
had disappeared. There has been found also
the little blue coffin of the Princess Sitamon,
daughter of Aahmes and Nefertari.</p>

<p>The theories and ideas of the Egyptians seem
utterly strange to us. So strong was their belief
in a future existence that their whole life in this
world was a preparation for it, and the greatest
care was taken that every portion of the body
should be preserved—that no limb or member
should be lacking in another world.</p>

<p>The Egyptian was, according to his own idea,
archeological authorities tell us, a composite being,
composed of several different entities, of
which each had its functions and its own life.
There was, first, the body, then the double, or
“Ka,” images of which are found so constantly
in the tombs and reproduced in paintings and
statues, as we remember that of Queen Mertytefs
and her Ka, before described. This double bore,
in miniature, the form and lineaments of the departed,
and was a sort of second example of the
body in a less dense material than the corporal
body. A colored projection but an aerial one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the individual. It represented the departed, feature
for feature, male or female, adult or child.</p>

<p>After the double came the soul, “Ba” or “Bai,”
which the popular imagination represented under
the figure of a bird; and after the soul the luminous
particle of light, “Khau,” detached from the
divine fire. None of these were imperishable,
and the man left to himself would die a second
time and fall into nothing. By embalmment the
body was preserved from destruction, and by
prayers and offerings the other portions of this
strange and composite whole. The double remained
always with the mummy, the others went
and came. The places of sepulchre for the sovereigns
were the numerous pyramids, usually having
sides to the points of the compass and a door
to the north; these were frequently enlarged and
altered by succeeding monarchs, as that of Mycerenas
was so extended and beautified by Queen
Nitocris that it often bore her name, instead of
its first builder.</p>

<p>The stele were originally false doors by which
the living world was supposed to communicate
with the dead. Food for the departed was often
placed before the door, and later represented
upon it, which by incantations became real. At
last the stele were used only as a place for inscriptions.
This applies merely to funerary stele.
Sometimes there was a statue or bas-relief in the
stele.</p>

<p>To the pyramids were added grottoes, rock,
tombs and caves, not alone for royalty, and the
mastabas built of brick, like a truncated pyramid,
and so named by the Arabs because they resembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the long, low seat used in Oriental houses.
Naturally, the more important the person buried
was deemed the more indestructible were the materials
of his tomb, and the more care was taken
to preserve them. Not many tombs were found
before the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties until the
later discovery of the burial places of the kings
of the First Dynasty. It is the mastabas and
smaller tombs at Gizeh and elsewhere that teach
us about the earliest period in Egyptian history,
those at Thebes later, and Beni-Hasen the Middle
Empire. The monuments and temples were the
canvas upon which the self-glorifying kings
painted their own history, and it is the absence
of these, as has been before shown, which leaves
the period in comparative darkness. It is the
tomb of Ty in the Fourth Dynasty and those of
Beni-Hassen in the Twelfth which are so invaluable
in giving the pictures of the daily life during
their respective eras.</p>

<p>We read of a stele or tablet (which in the
Eighteenth Dynasty were usually rounded at the
top) on which at the left is seated the figure of
King Amosis or Aahmes and “the divine spouse
of Amen, the royal spouse, Aahmes-Nefertari,”
also at the left are seated King Amenophis I and
his spouse, Aahmes-Nefertari. “Is it the same
queen?” questioned Mariette, yet the spelling and
the faces are different. There is also a stele
bearing the name of King Aahmes and his mother,
Queen Aah-hotep. Another statue is spoken
of, whose pure profile recalls the handsome portraits
of Seti I. It represents the god Amen
standing. On the base we read in red ink, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the legend of Amenophis I, “the royal spouse
whom he loves, Aahmes-Nefertari.”</p>

<p>The mourning color of the Egyptians, as now
of the Burmese, was yellow, and it is curious to
observe how varied in this respect are the customs
of different lands. With us, and all over
Europe, since the days of Rome black is the
usual, as it seems the most natural, trapping of
woe; but it is stated that until 1498 white was
worn in Spain for the members of the family, as
it or yellow now is in China. In Turkey the
mourning color is a bright violet, while formerly
purple and violet were assumed for the kings and
cardinals of France. In Bokara and other parts
of Asia deep blue is used, and in Syria and Armenia,
sky blue. In Persia it is pale brown, the
color of winter leaves; in the Soudan, grayish
brown, the color of the earth; and among the
South Sea Islanders a black and white striped
goods serves for this purpose.</p>

<p>By different nations, too, various days in the
week are observed for public worship. The
Christians keep Sunday, the Greeks Monday, the
Persians Tuesday, the Assyrians Wednesday, the
Egyptians Thursday, the Turks Friday, and the
Jews Saturday.</p>

<p>At the time of a death, in token of grief the
mourning women would leave the house where
the body was lying, put dust and mud on their
heads and faces, and with bare bosoms run
through the streets, striking themselves and uttering
lamentations. Some of the pictures show
even little children thus testifying sorrow, and
there is something both pathetic and ludicrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in the scene. At the death and funeral of a
member of the royal family great ceremony was
observed. The people wept, the temples were
closed, and no festival was kept for seventy-two
days. The mourners fasted and went round with
mud on their heads and their garments knotted
together, like girdles, below the breast. They
marched in procession, singing funeral dirges.
The statement is somewhere made that women of
quality were not embalmed immediately, but in
so warm a climate the process could not have
been long delayed.</p>

<p>From the use of bitumen, “mumia,” the word
“mummy” is derived. There were several methods
of preservation, varying in expense with the
dignity of the deceased and the financial ability
of the survivors. The work of preparation for
the tomb was, especially in the case of the
wealthy and high-born, costly and protracted, and
all details were prescribed. The person who, in
the service of the embalmer, commenced the task
by making a long cut in the side, was, as a matter
of form, it is generally believed, driven away
with sticks and stones, but some authorities deny
this. The organs were then removed through
this opening, embalmed and placed in jars, each
under the protection of its special god, the four
children of Horus. Mesta, with the head of a
man, was for the stomach, and, under the protection
of Isis, thus justifying a modern theory that
a man can be influenced largely through his appetite
and is most amiable after dining. The jar
Hapi, with the head of an ape, held the smaller
intestines, under the protection of Nepthys. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
jar Tuan-antef, with the head of a jackal, was for
the heart, guarded by Neith. Qubhsennuf was
hawk-headed and held the liver. Examples of all
these may perhaps be seen in the New York
Metropolitan Museum among the Egyptian antiquities
and other places. On a box for funerary
jars is a figure of Isis, and the inscription, “Says
Isis, the divine mother, queen of heaven, first of
the gods: ‘I am come that I may be for thy protection,
Osiris Chonsu.’”</p>

<p>The body was laid in liquid natron for seventy
days, and was then stuffed with spices and natron
and sewed up again. Various trees have been
supposed to furnish the frankincense used by ancient
peoples, the Indian Olibanum among them.
The Egyptians used it in their religious rites,
burning it on the altars of Osiris, Isis and Pasht,
while it was exacted as tribute from some of the
conquered nations. It was also used by the Jews
in their sanctuary. All parts of the tree emit an
agreeable odor, something like lemon, the sap
hardens into the gum used in commerce, being
extracted by incisions in the bark, as is the case
with maple sugar. It is an evergreen, the leaves
are prettily notched, the flowers small, pink and
star-like, and the fruit also very small and three-sided.
It grows in Persia and Arabia.</p>

<p>After the body was thus prepared, the skull,
from which the brains had been drawn through
the nose, was filled with plaster and the nostrils
plugged with small rolls of linen, and obsidian
eyes placed in the sockets. The Book of the
Dead provided a formula for all this. The eye
of Horus was placed upon the breast, which signifies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the transformation by which life is preserved
and constantly renewed, and was consecrated
to the god Ptah. A scarab was laid on the
neck, the nails were stained with henna, rings
were placed on the hands and chains and necklets
on the throat. The bandages were narrow strips
of linen inscribed with texts.</p>

<p>When the head was bandaged, an attendant recited
this petition: “O most august goddess, O
lady of the West, O mistress of the East, come
and enter into the two ears of the deceased! O
doubly powerful, eternal, young and very mighty
lady of the West and mistress of the East, may
breathing take place in the head of the deceased
in the nether world. Grant that he may see with
his eyes, that he may hear with his two ears, that
he may breathe through his nose, that he may
utter sounds with his mouth and articulate with
his tongue in the nether world. Receive his voice
in the hall of truth and justice and his triumph
in the hall of Seb, in the presence of the great
lord of the West. O Osiris (this addressed to
the deceased), the thick oil which comes from
thee furnishes thy mouth with life and thine eye
looketh into the lower heaven, as Ra looketh upon
the upper heaven. It giveth thee thy two ears to
hear that which thou wishest, just as Shu in
Hebit heard merely that which he wished to hear.
It giveth thee thy nose to smell a beautiful perfume,
like Seb. It giveth thee thy mouth well
furnished by its passage (into the throat) like
the mouth of Thoth when he weigheth Maat. It
giveth thee Maat (Law) in Hebit, O worshipper
in Hetbenben, the cries of thy mouth are in Siut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Osiris of Siut comes to thee, thy mouth is the
mouth of Ap-not in the mountains of the West.”</p>

<p>The god Osiris, so often referred to, was the
great (unseen One), the immortal divine spirit,
and was always associated in the Egyptian’s mind
with the thought of immortality. He was usually
colored blue, the tint of the sky perhaps suggested
perpetuity and immortality. The Egyptians from
the earliest times seem to have worshipped one
divine spirit under a thousand manifestations.</p>

<p>The coffins and covering were of wood, with
human head and face; painted with figures of
gods, names and titles of the deceased, and cartouch
of the king. Inside was frequently a purple
ground, painted with yellow figures of apes,
lions, etc., adoring Ra. The face on the coffin
was often a likeness, and the coffin was painted
inside and out with figures of protecting gods.
Another coffin, more coarsely made and with less
of detail in its paintings, was placed over the first
to preserve it. A lady’s coffin sometimes contained
spoons with female heads and various
toilette articles, mirrors, pins and cases for henna,
stibium and other cosmetics, while miniature figures,
the little “ushebti,” like troops of slaves,
mounted guard. Sometimes these were hollow
and contained chapters from the Book of the
Dead. An ordinance required that the nearest
city should embalm persons who were drowned
or seized by crocodiles.</p>

<p>The funeral procession included players on
lyres, flutes, harps and servants carrying inverted
bouquets, a red calf for sacrifice and white geese.
A sort of court was held before the body was deposited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in the tomb, in which those who had accusations
against the deceased were allowed to
present them. If these were sustained, the mummy
was sent back to the house; but if not, the
priest cried “Approved! Let the good be entombed,
and may their souls dwell in Amenti,
with Osiris. Judgment is passed in her favor!
Let her be buried!” The dead sometimes carried
a papyrus on which his good deeds were written.
The mummy was placed recumbent or upright in
the tomb, and the soul was received by Horus
and conducted to Amenti, where a sort of Cerberus
kept the gate of Truth. The goddess of
Justice, with scales of gold, weighed the virtues
of the deceased, which the god Thoth wrote down
on a tablet, like the scribes of their daily life, and,
after reading, Osiris presented him with the ostrich
feather, the emblem of Truth, while Isis
led him to the abode of the gods, where he dwelt
in perpetual honor and happiness.</p>

<p>Very poetical are some of the tomb inscriptions
relating to the future state. “The Shining
One cometh who dwelleth in Netat, the Master
who dwelleth in Tini (Thinis), and Isis speaks
upon thee. Nephthys holdeth converse with thee,
and the Shining Ones come up to thee, bowing
down even to the ground in adoration at thy
feet, by reason of the power of the writing which
thou hast, O Pepi, in the region of Sa (Sabu?).
Thou goest forth to thy Mother Nut (i.e., the
sky), and strengthen thy arm, and she maketh a
way for thee through the road to the sky” (perhaps
referring to the Milky Way) “to the place
where Ra (the sun-deity) abideth. Thou hast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
then opened the two gates of heaven, thou hast
opened the two doors of Quobhu (i.e., the celestial
deep), thou hast there found Ra and he
watcheth over thee, he hath taken thee by thy
hand, he hath guided thee into temples of heaven,
and he hath placed thee upon the throne of Osiris.”
We are reminded of some parts of the
book of Job or some of the picturesque speeches
of our own North American Indian.</p>

<p>Nefertari-Aahmes was a devout worshipper of
the gods, like her mother before her, and made
valuable gifts to the temples, so these funeral
rites were doubtless observed with great care and
ceremony, especially as she had many children,
some of whom survived her, to pay the last tributes
of love and respect. The list is given as
Meryt-amen, the eldest daughter, who died
young; Sat-amen, a second daughter, who died
as an infant; Sa’pair, the eldest son, of whom
some statuettes and memorials remain, though
he also appears to have died young and did not
succeed his father; Aah-hotep, doubtless named
after the beloved grandmother, and who also became
queen later; Amenhotep I, who succeeded
his father, and Sat-Kames, a daughter. Besides
Nefertari-Aahmes, the king seems to have had
another royal wife, called Queen Anhapi, who
bore him a daughter, Hent’ta’mehu, and a secondary
wife, whose name is preserved as Kasmut,
and who bore him Tair and other children.
Queen on earth and goddess in heaven though
she might be, Queen Aahmes-Nefertari had the
common human experience of sorrow; she lost a
number of children, and though holding the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
place, and doubtless having her own establishment,
shared her husband’s attention and affection
with various rivals. Yet human ambition
could reach no greater height; she was recorded
as “the royal daughter, sister and great royal
wife, royal mother, great ruler, mistress of both
lands.” The ancestress and foundress of her
race, she had a priesthood of her own, a large sacred
shrine, and was worshipped like the great
gods at Abydos, Karnak and Thebes. She is believed
to have outlived her husband, and to have
reigned temporarily for her son, who was associated
with her and worshipped with her at
Thebes. “She sits enthroned with her husband,”
says one writer, “at the head of all the Pharonic
pairs and before all the royal children of their
race, as the specially venerated ancestress of the
Eighteenth Dynasty.” Her title of wife of the
god Amen expressly designated the chief priestess
of the tutelary god of Thebes.</p>

<p>The wife and children of Aahmes often adopted
or combined his name with their own and encircled
it with their cartouch. The king was
called “the golden Horus, the binding together
of the two lands.” His coffin and body were
found at Deir-el-Bahri. The coffin was of the
new style, plain in outline, less massive and
shaped to the figure behind, painted yellow,
picked out with blue, instead of gilt. The body
was fairly preserved, the head long and small,
with thick and wavy hair, not shaved, as later.
The muscles were strong and vigorous, and he
might have been something over fifty at the time
of his death. Not a long life, but that of a warrior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was perhaps necessarily a hard one. The
mummy case of the queen was one of the largest
and most magnificent ever discovered, and at the
time it was found contained also the mummy of
Thothmes or Tehutimes III, which, left unexamined
and not properly cared for, decomposed,
and had to be buried. A headless statue of
Queen Aahmes-Nefertari, smaller statuettes,
scarabs and a bas-relief or a statue in which she
appears with her son Amenophis I exist. So
king and queen passed from earth to the delights
of heaven, and, as Curtis expresses it, exchanged
“the silver for the golden goblet.”</p>

<p>Amenhotep, Amenophis or Amenothes, son of
Aahmes and Nefertari-Aahmes, succeeded his
father, and married his sister Aah-hotep II, or
some say Nefutari, of whom, beyond her name,
we know little or nothing. The king was about
twenty, she probably younger, at the time. Like
his father before him, he was a warrior, and is
pictured holding captives by the hair, probably
Lydians. His children are given as Uaz’mes,
Aahmes, Tehutimes I, Neb’ta and Mutnefert,
whose statue is at Karnak. The first two are on
the tomb of a certain Peperi, where the king
holds Prince Uaz’mes on his knee.</p>

<p>The mummy of the king is among those that
have been discovered. It was clothed in an
orange robe, held in place by bands of linen.
There was a mask of wood and painted pasteboard
identical with the outside. He was enveloped
from head to foot with long garlands,
among which a wasp had crawled, attracted by
the flowers, and thus preserved for centuries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
According to the traditions, he also was a devout
worshipper of the gods, and accorded divine honors.
So for all these had come the day when
they drew towards “the land that loveth silence.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_8">CHAPTER EIGHTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">HATSHEPSUT.</span></h2>

<p>With Hatshepsut, or Hatsu, some 1600 B. C.,
we come to the most celebrated of all the Egyptian
queens, not perhaps excluding the world-renowned
Cleopatra, and her reign bears also a
noteworthy feature, an especial ornament to a
woman’s brow—it was a reign of peace. Her father
and brothers, especially the younger, were
warriors, but she was not. To the male of all
species the fighting instinct more particularly and
rightfully belongs. No wars of defence, none of
aggression and conquest, disturbed the peaceful
course of her rule. The arts flourished, and
friendly expeditions sought distant shores to gain
fresh knowledge of the outer world, to extend
the hand of fellowship, and to exchange in the
ordinary channels of commerce the products and
manufactures of one land for those of the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="375" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Hatasu.</span></p>
</div>

<p>No such lengthened gap exists between Hatshepsut
and the previous kings as we have noted
earlier in our study. She was in direct descent,
being the great-grand-daughter of Aahmes and
Nefertari-Aahmes, and the grand-daughter of
Amenhotep or Amenophis I. Her father was
Tutmes or Tahutmes I, “Thut’s child,” and her
mother, probably his sister, Aahmes, A’mose or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Amensi, of whom there is a profile portrait in one
of Maspero’s books. Some things suggest that
the mother of Queen Amensi was of different
and higher birth than the mother of Tahutmes,
and this may account for the position which
seemed at once accorded to Hatshepsut. Another
legend states that the god Amen was Hatshepsut’s
father, and being of divine origin, a
sort of Minerva sprung from the brain of Jupiter,
she took unquestioned the first place; but she
was evidently of the blood royal and the arrangement
which gave her precedence of her
brothers and claim to the crown did not seem to
be disputed. Every princess at her birth received
the title of “royal consort.” A son and daughter
of Tahutmes, probably older than Hatshepsut,
died in childhood, the former named Uatmes
(who by some is believed to be brother rather
than son of Tahutmes) and a daughter Kheb-no-fru-ra
or Nefer’kebt. Tahutmes himself is
considered the son of Amenhotep I and Queen
Sen-semb.</p>

<p>Tahutmes I, like his predecessors, was a warrior.
He fought in the north, made conquests in
Palestine and Syria and penetrated into Mesopotamia.
A stele, erected east of the Euphrates,
bore record of his victories, but his daughter
adopted a different policy. She and her brother
regarded many of these conquests as empty possessions,
difficult to retain and of no real value
to the kingdom, so preferred to abandon them.</p>

<p>Hatshepsut rejoiced in the usual wealth of
names, in addition to or instead of that by which
she is most generally known, Hatasu, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
writer selecting a different one for his own
reasons. These were Hatshopsitou, Hasheps,
Hatshepsut, which seems to be generally used by
Petrie, Khnumt-Amen, Chuemtamun, the throne
name Ra-ma-ka, Maat-ka-ra, etc., as derived
from different languages and given by different
authorities.</p>

<p>The Egyptian’s awe of and respect for his
monarch was usually so great that he hesitated
to speak of him directly, but used some circumlocution
or descriptive phrase. The name of the
god Ra seems to have been frequently, though
not invariably, introduced. This was the principal
solar deity of Egypt, the “sun-god,” the
“father of gods and men,” the chief seat of this
very ancient worship being Heliopolis. The
sun’s disk was his emblem, and he was pictured
as hawk-headed.</p>

<p>The tie between Tahutmes I and his daughter,
admirable wherever seen, was one of close
affection, and the former doubtless recognized
and took pride in the ability of his gifted child.
The male historians, with one or two exceptions,
seem rather grudgingly to admit Hatasu’s claims,
pass somewhat slightingly over her achievements
and attribute to her successors what may
really be her due. Miss Edwards, on the contrary,
is fired with enthusiasm, encircles this
queenly figure with the halo of her own poetic
imagination and claims for her certain engineering
works which others believe to be the performance
of her successors.</p>

<p>There is one familiar portrait bust, a copy of
which is in the Metropolitan Museum in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
York and in other places, which has been appropriated
by different authorities to different
queens. It is a smiling, womanly face, with well-rounded
lips and a dimpled chin. Mariette calls
it Queen Ti, Maspero believes it to be the wife of
Horemheb, and Miss Edwards claims it as
Hatasu. The original, in limestone and of
colossal size, is at Gizeh. It is a masterpiece of
Egyptian art and was found in a chamber back
of the obelisk of Hatasu at Karnak, which perhaps
gives color to Miss Edwards’ theory. She
says of it, “the eyes laugh, the lips all but speak,
and every feature is alive with a vivacious charm
which is the rarest achievement in sculpture.”
Certainly, if it be this queen, beauty and charm
were added to mental capacity. A half-mocking
smile wreathes the lips and seems to suggest a
keen sense of humor.</p>

<p>Maspero describes her, probably in later life,
and says her portraits have “refined features and
a proud and energetic expression. The oval of
the face is elongated, cheeks a little hollow, eyes
deep set under arch of brows, lips thin and
tightly closed.” Many little statuettes, headless
statues, etc., exist in various places. The temple
of Deir el Bahri was approached by an avenue of
sphinxes, each figure head being a portrait of
the queen, two of which are preserved at Berlin.
One, brought from Thebes and thought to be
done in comparatively recent years with brows
and eyes inlaid, is in the Metropolitan Museum.
Her Ka statue was in her temple in the shape of
a small bearded man, which was probably taken
at the period when she wore male attire. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the Ka arms and the Ka name of the queen,
grasps the ankh and feather of Ma in its right
hand, and a human headed staff, also like the
queen, in its left. Her cartouch is on the shoulder
of the previously mentioned statue and the
father and daughter are often united in a double
cartouch.</p>

<p>Hatshepsut has been called the Semiramis,
the Catharine, and the Elizabeth of Egyptian history.
Bold and clever, no ideal womanly soul
was this, but the masculine grasp, the masculine
intellect was hers. Strong but centered on a
few her love was probably not given to the
many; her attachment to her father cannot be
doubted. Her ambition and determination to
keep the royal power is evident, but it was not
the ambition of the soldier and the conqueror.
She loved power, she wished to rule, but the belongings
of others did not excite her cupidity.
Her desire was to build up her own kingdom,
and the way to that was not, in her eyes, through
annexation and conquest. No claims of posterity,
no pleas for “the cause of humanity” stained
her pathway with blood. One of her boasts was
that she had imported and caused to grow a great
variety of trees. Some philosopher has said that
he who can make two blades of grass grow where
one grew before is the greatest benefactor of his
race, and some such credit as this seems rightfully
to belong to Queen Hatshepsut.</p>

<p>The early historians, whose mistakes later discoveries
have corrected, combined Hatshepsut
and Nitocris, calling this composite figure Amen-Nitocris,
and said that she was the last of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Memphite sovereigns and by a marriage with
Thothmes united the crowns of Upper and
Lower Egypt. That she was handsome among
women and brave among men, that she governed
with splendor, added to the temple of Karnak
and built the smallest of the pyramids. But the
patient research of scholars has disentangled the
two stories and given to each her own meed of
fame.</p>

<p>The mummy of Tahutmes I was among those
found at Deir el Bahri and the body showed him
to have been a man of vigor, with a fine form.
His coffin and other relics, bricks with his name,
etc., were also found. Of his mother Sensenb
there was a picture on the walls of the temple at
Deir el Bahri as of Hatshepsut’s mother, Queen
Aahmes, wearing the royal asp and head-dress.
In these the conventional form is of course
strictly preserved and yet there is a certain individuality.
Pictures (reproductions of them) may
be seen in Petrie’s and Mahaffy’s history of
Egypt, as in other places. An ivory wand of
Queen Aahmes, scarabs, etc., remain. Queen
Mut’nefert appears to have been another wife of
Tahutmes I and mother of Tahutmes II. She
was said to have been a daughter of Amenhotep
and appears on the statue of her son Tahutmes
II at Karnak as “royal daughter, royal wife.”
“A fine statue of her,” says Petrie, “made of
sandstone, was found in the chapel of Uazmes
and bears the inscription ‘The good god, lord of
both lands, Aa’kheperren’ra (Tahutmes II)
made by him his monuments of his mother;
royal wife, royal mother, Mut’nefert, makheru.’”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
These relics seem to give proof of the respect and
affection of the children for their parents, but
beyond our limited knowledge of the bare facts
of their relationships the two queens are but
mere names and we turn to the more clearly defined
and striking figure of the great queen
Hatshepsut.</p>

<p>In the latter part of his reign Tahutmes I associated
his daughter with him in the imperial
power, as he had probably taken her into his
counsel previously in matters of state policy and
shared with her all the pleasures of his daily
life. Their mutual devotion and his high appreciation
of her great abilities is evident, even after
the lapse of centuries.</p>

<p>The two half-brothers of Hatshepsut were
Tahutmes II and Tahutmes III, or as later authorities
say Tahutmes III was son of Tahutmes
II, the latter proved to be a ruler of great ability,
but neither seemed to hold the place in the
father’s regard that she did, and being much
younger were naturally not equally companionable
to him. The limestone statue of Queen
Mut-nefert, mother of Tahutmes II, before referred
to, was found at Thebes in 1886 and is
now at Gizeh. Her son had it carved and it was
in the ruins of a little temple. She is seated, in
a long white robe, which shows the form and the
flesh is colored yellow. The whole is refined and
well proportioned, and despite the mutilation of
the nose one notices the sweetness of expression,
lightened by large eyes. To this day one sees
the type near Thebes. The mother of Tahutmes
III was more truly a concubine and was called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the Lady As’t, she was a royal mother but not a
royal wife.</p>

<p>Shortly before her father’s death, according to
the Egyptian custom, Hatshepsut married her
brother Tahutmes II, who shared the throne with
her or she with him, but it is evident she was the
ruling spirit. There is little doubt that she was
the elder of the two; it is estimated that at this
time she was about twenty-four and Tahutmes
seventeen. A somewhat similar instance to this
is narrated by the African traveller, Captain A.
St. H. Gibbons, who describes an ancient custom
which he found prevailing at Nalolo, whereby
the eldest surviving sister of the ruling king was
invested with the prerogatives of a queen, without
whose advice and consent her brother could
not arrange matters of state. She was absolute
in her own district, held the power of life and
death over her subjects and wedded or deposed
a husband at will.</p>

<p>A statue of Tahutmes II exists at Gizeh, which
bears some resemblance to the ancient King
Chafre. He is not of large size, has fine pathetic
eyes, a gentle expression and perhaps resembles
his mother. That no love was lost between
the consorts is evident from the fact that
Hatsheput conferred such special marks of favor
upon her architect Semut, and after the death of
Tahutmes II (in which old historians, some of
them, though perhaps unfairly, were disposed to
implicate her) she erased his name from many
of the monuments, giving all honor, where possible,
to her father or keeping it for herself, to the
great bewilderment of later day students. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
is said to have detained Tahutmes II, in his
younger days, in Buto, away from her palace and
the seat of power, and doubtless relegated him to
the background wherever she could. No more
than Queen Elizabeth perhaps had custom and
conventionality permitted her to stand quite
alone, would she have accepted a consort.</p>

<p>Dress, which had for many reigns and centuries
remained unchanged, began somewhat to
alter at the time of the Eighteenth Dynasty and
more rapidly later. The highest orders of
women wore petticoats or gowns secured at the
waist by a colored sash, or a strap over the
shoulder and over this a large loose robe of the
finest linen and tied in front and under the
breast, the right arm was left exposed at religious
ceremonies and funerals. Another description
says that the long tunic, called a basui,
was suspended by straps or bracers over the
shoulders or a short petticoat with the body
strapped over the shoulder and a loose upper
garment, which exposed the breast and which
could be easily laid aside. There also came
changes in the patterns of beads, mode of glazing,
hair dressing, furniture and the painting of
tombs. The net work of beads was of course
largely used for the decoration of mummies. The
admixture of blood with Syrian and other captives,
as wives and concubines, seemed to introduce
a new ideal type, with small features and
fascinating, graceful figures. The ends of the
braided hair were fringed during the Middle
Empire, and during the New the face was
framed with wonderful plaits and short tresses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
which were secured with combs. Or, more
naturally, it hung loose or was bound with a
fillet. Female servants wore their hair fastened
at the back of the head with loops or plaits. They
had a plain garment with short sleeves, but
threw off the upper part when working. In the
earliest times, as has before been said, men
seemed to care for dress more than women.
From the queen to the peasant female attire was
similar, and from the Fourth to the Eighteenth
Dynasty there was little change. About the
time of Hatshepsut it assumed a new character,
and the upper part of the body was also clothed.
At one period color and pattern had been almost
excluded and the higher classes wore linen so
fine that the figure showed through. Bands
woven or embroidered were later added, but their
neighbors, the Syrians, always wore more elaborate
embroidery than the Egyptians. Shend’ot
was the name of the royal dress under the Old
Empire. Men wore a short skirt round the hips,
and a second was added during the Middle Empire;
in one century this was short and narrow,
in another wide and shapeless, and in a third,
peculiarly folded; the breast was also covered,
and the apron, now chiefly a female appanage,
was then exclusively the property of men.</p>

<p>Costumes differed with classes, yet, as with
us, a fashion initiated by uppertendom would
sometimes descend and spread. The lords and
the priests and priestesses in offering sacrifices
bore a panther skin thrown over the shoulder, the
small head and forepaws hanging down. To
the hindpaws long ribbons were attached, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
were drawn forward, and it was the fashion to
play with them when sitting idle. Perhaps it
was an aid to conversation thus to trifle, as with
Madame de Stael’s well-known sprig of poplar.
Soldiers and merchants wore white garments
bordered with colored fringes. Policemen carried
staves, and priests went about in long white
robes with aprons and jewelled collars.</p>

<p>The woman’s short petticoat under the tunic,
called a basni, was white, red, yellow and sometimes,
in the Middle Empire, green. The higher
orders sometimes secured the petticoat at the
waist with a colored sash. Occasionally there
was only one sleeve for the left arm. The cloak
of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties fell
over the arms with a short sleeve added and at
the end of the Twentieth Dynasty there was a
thick underdress. The bare foot of the earliest
times, as has been shown, was later sandalled and
shod.</p>

<p>As time went on the tendency seemed to be
more and more to vary from the fashions of the
Garden of Eden and to add to the amount of
clothing. The more civilized the nation the more
elaborate the covering. The primitive Egyptian
thought more of painting and rouging the face
and oiling the limbs, of both living and dead,
than he did of dress. Two colors were chiefly
used, green, with which under the Old Empire
they put a line below the eye, and black for
brows and lids, to make the eyes look larger and
more brilliant. The eyelids were dyed with
mestem, the finger nails made red with henna.
For this, of course, many kohl pots and mirrors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
were needed. The latter were of burnished
metal, chiefly of copper, round, with wooden or
ivory handles and ornamented with carved lotus
buds. Necklaces and bracelets on the upper arm
and wrist were worn by both men and women,
but the latter only used anklets. Earrings were
round, single loops of gold, and rings, especially
on the third finder and thumb, were numerous.</p>

<p>Of the daily life of a queen we have no detailed
account, but various pictures and inscriptions
make a sort of outline which study and imagination
may fill up and not be utterly astray. One
writer has sketched some such programme as
this, of course that of a queen who was herself
regent, or ruled in her own right. After the first
meal of the day the queen would go to the throne
room and listen to reports, petitions, etc., doubtless
attended by scribes, who were more ubiquitous
than even the modern reporter, to note down
everything and extol her majesty’s power, clemency
and charm. Before the heat grew excessive
she might walk in the garden or among the colonnades
of the palace or ride out to take the air
and view the public works which were in process
of building.</p>

<p>Neither horses nor camels are represented on
the monuments in the earliest times. Persons of
distinction were borne in chariots or chairs carried
by bands of slaves, and the ass or mule was
the beast of burden. A royal chariot was sometimes
adorned by a burnished shield rising above
the back, carved with open work and lined with
silk. It had two wheels, and a pair of horses
were attached to the car by a single trace, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
heads held up by a bridle made fast to a hook in
front of the saddle. The long reins passed
through a loop at the side; the horses’ heads were
adorned with plumes, and the harness and housings
ornamented with the royal devices in gold,
silver and brass. Sometimes for ladies there was
a seat, one in each chariot, but the usual rule was
not to have any, a man stood. Says one writer,
“When the queen rides she stands on a dais
borne at speed by six horses abreast, and looks
like a flying goddess.” Thus perhaps our fancy
may paint Queen Hatshepsut.</p>

<p>Later came the mid-day dinner, usual in Egypt,
then doubtless a rest during the hottest hours,
after which the reception of ambassadors and
court dignitaries and an evening given more to
pleasures, such as music and watching the acrobatic
sports and juggling of trained performers
and the dancing of female slaves. The guest
whom the queen delighted to honor had a special
place assigned him at table, portions sent to him
from the royal dishes and sometimes, as a particular
mark of favor, had a gold chain placed about
his neck by the monarch’s own hand.</p>

<p>The throne room was probably a magnificent
apartment of immense size with a polished floor,
on which were laid the skins of beasts. Enormous
statues of the gods, chief among them,
Osiris and Isis, were ranged on either side, between
tall granite columns with lotus capitals,
looking like a forest of great trees. The throne
of ivory stood on a raised platform, to which one
ascended by steps, guarded on either side by
carven figures of sphinxes and crouching animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Behind were again immense statues of
Justice and Truth. The steps were of valuable
marbles, and the throne itself inlaid with jewels,
all the numbers and designs were symbolic, the
footstool was of precious marbles, in a gold
frame, and above the throne was a canopy of silk
upheld by slender white and gold columns and
embroidered with the stars and constellations.
Bands of soldiers and officers, richly attired,
waited upon the queen. She, on all solemn occasions,
wore the double crown of Egypt, which
one writer describes as a graceful conical bonnet
of white silk, ending in a knob like a pomegranite,
the color white, of Upper, as the outer
band of gold lined with red silk, was of Lower
Egypt, the vulture wings and the raised asp. Her
garments were of finest linen with silk robe of
white and green and a girdle adorned with diamonds
and precious stones. With these or similar
surroundings we imagine Queen Hatshepsut.</p>

<p>There is a picture in Erman of King “Tuet-anch-amun”
giving audience to a governor of
Ethiopia. The king wears his war helmet and
carries a whip and sceptre, while the governor
bears a sceptre and fan as sign of rank. The
king is called “Lord of Hermothis.” Sceptre and
whip doubtless Hatshepsut could wield right royally,
but the war bonnet she probably had little
occasion for. Some writers claim that it was her
father’s conquests which gave her immunity from
warfare and that it was her peaceful reign and
neglect to keep the wild tribes in orderly submission
that paved the way for the career of
bloodshed which distinguished her great successor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Tahutmes III, so that on this question, as
on most, there will always remain a wide difference
of opinion. But that a peaceful reign is in
many respects a great blessing and a justifiable
cause of pride to its successful promoter, and
that peace and not war is the ideal state, cannot
be denied.</p>

<p>The coronation of Hatshepsut, the building of
her great temple at Deir el Bahri and the expedition
to Punt are events of such moment that they
deserve a volume rather than the narrow space of
a single chapter to do them justice.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_9">CHAPTER NINTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">HATSHEPSUT (CONCLUDED).</span></h2>

<p>An inscription in the temple of Karnak reads
thus, it is as it were the deed of gift of the royal
father Tahutmes I to his favorite child, and addressed
to the god Amen: “I bestow the Black
Land and the Red Land upon my daughter, the
queen of Lower and Upper Egypt Ma-Ka-ra, living
eternally. Thou hast transmitted the world
into her power, thou hast chosen her as king.”
Hatshepsut claimed divine origin in that the god
Amen had taken upon him the person of her
father and in an especial manner considered herself
the daughter of the god. Hatshepset spelled
with the e means “the first among the favorite
women,” but the queen changed the e to u and
later called herself Hatshepsut, which signifies
“the first among the great and honorable nobles
of the kingdom,” which she considered more befitting
her exalted position.</p>

<p>The Eighteenth Dynasty is included in the
Golden Age of Egyptian history, and in no period
was its power more widely felt, its individual
monarchs more remarkable or its architectural
and literary remains grander or more impressive.</p>

<p>Before his death Tahutmes I seems to have
had celebrated the marriage of his two children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
his daughter of twenty-four and his son of seventeen.
All things combined to put Hatshepsut
in the first place, her more royal heritage, by the
mother’s side, her father’s devotion to her, her
superiority in years and her more striking talents,
while Tahutmes II was perhaps both physically
and mentally her inferior. Death at last had
severed the tie which bound father and daughter
together, but no such tender feeling seems to
have existed between the two now occupying the
throne, hers was the dominant will, hers is the
prominent figure. After this she frequently wore
male attire and the dress and ornaments belonging
to a king, and doubtless, had it been a matter
of choice, she would have been a man.</p>

<p>She styles herself “King Horus abounding in
divine gifts, mistress of diadems, rich in years
(not a claim the modern lady is ever anxious to
establish) the golden Horus, goddess of diadems,
queen of Upper and Lower Egypt, daughter of
the sun, consort of Ammon, daughter of Ammon,
living forever and dwelling in his breast.” Another
inscription reads, speaking of her by her
name Cheremtamun, “He has created (her) in
order to exalt his splendor. She who creates beings
like the god Chefr’a. She whose diadems
shine like those of the god of the horizon.”</p>

<p>She used both the male and female sign and
the title, “daughter of the sun.” As the sphinx
bore sometimes a male, sometimes a female head,
so this strange and wonderful woman assumed
now the one, now the other character. A curious
life this old Egyptian history brings before
us, so permeated as it was with the constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
thought of death and its belief, real or assumed,
in the actual intercourse with a race of superior
beings, gods, and yet set forth in the lowest
images of the brute creation. To the poor and
uneducated doubtless as in all idolatrous countries,
the semblance seemed the reality and their
thought did not pierce beyond the image before
them, but the more intellectual and spiritual
minds must have rent the veil of sense and
stretched out longingly to the infinite beyond, if
peradventure they might “feel after and find” the
truly godlike.</p>

<p>Hatshepsut did not at once set to work, like
the early kings, to build a pyramid in which she
might herself be interred. Mundane subjects at
first occupied her, and later she built a memorial
to her father in the form of an obelisk which described
his powers and virtues, and temples for
the worship and to the glory of the gods.</p>

<p>Probably the regulation of the country and the
administration of internal affairs occupied the
earliest years of Hatshepsut’s rule, after the death
of Tahutmes I, but in them she was also preparing
for the expedition which was one of the great
features of her reign and took place in its ninth
year. Punt, a country on the eastern bank of the
Red Sea, had been, to some extent, known to
the Egyptians in the earliest times, those of
Chafre’ of the Fourth Dynasty. “Under the
name of Punt,” says one writer, “the old inhabitants
of Kemi meant a distant land washed by
the great ocean, full of valleys and hills, abounding
in ebony and other rich woods, balsams,
spices, precious metals and stones and of animals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
hunting-leopards, panthers, dog-headed
apes, etc.” It was the Ophir of the Egyptians,
the present coast of Somali, perhaps the land in
sight of Arabia, but separated by the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Old traditions said that it was the original seat
of the gods, and from it had travelled the holy
ones to the Nile valley, at their head Amen, called
Kak, as king of Punt, Horus and Hathor. This
last was the queen and ruler of Punt, Hor, the
holy morning star, which rose to the west of the
land. The god Bes also was peculiarly associated
with the country. Under the last king of
the Eleventh Dynasty is said to have taken place
the first journey to Ophir and Punt, and the envoys
sent were attended by three thousand men
and brought back spices and precious stones.
After that it seemed to relapse in the popular
imagination into a sort of fairyland which was
inhabited by strange serpents.</p>

<p>Like a new Columbus the great queen decided
to attempt the rediscovery and exploration of
these distant shores. Amen of Thebes, the lord
of gods, it is said, had suggested the thought to
her, “because he held this ruler so dear, dearer
than any other king who had been in this country.”
Pictures and accounts of this expedition
were afterwards placed in illustration on the
walls of the temple of Deir-el-Bahari, built by
the queen, and the inscription concludes with the
statement that nothing like it had been done under
any king before. “And,” says an authority
on these subjects, “it speaks the truth. Hatasu
showed her people the way to the land whose
products were later to fill the treasuries not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of the Pharaohs, but also of the Phoenicians and
the Jews.”</p>

<p>It was a peaceful expedition, perhaps the only
one that had ever been sent forth, this voyage of
discovery, nearly sixteen hundred years before
the Christian Era; but of course great preparations
and even some military ones had to be
made that in case of unexpected attack they
might be prepared. Ships were built for the expedition,
and doubtless years passed between the
time of the first conception of the enterprise and
its execution.</p>

<p>An inscription by the picture of the squadron
thus describes it. “Departure of the squadron of
the Lord of the two Worlds, traversing the great
sea on the Good Way to the Land of the gods,
in obedience to the will of the King of the gods,
Amen of Thebes. He commanded that there
should be brought to him the marvellous products
of the Land of Punt, for he loveth the Queen
Hatasu above all other kings that have ruled this
land.”</p>

<p>A canal connecting the Nile with the Red Sea
which has been attributed to Seti I Miss Edwards
claims as an engineering feat of Hatasu,
as it would shorten the length of the voyage
rather than to take the almost inconceivably long
trip around the west coast of Africa, the Cape of
Good Hope, the Mosambique Channel and the
coast of Zanzibar.</p>

<p>The ships, five in number, were large and
stately for the time. They are described as having
a narrow keel with stern and prow high
above the water, seventy feet in length and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
no cabin accommodations. A raised platform at
either end, with a balustrade, probably afforded
some shelter to the officers. A single mast supported
the spreading sail, there were no decks
and the hull was fitted with seats for the rowers.
After the Old Empire all large boats were
adapted for sailing, as well as rowing. Other
vessels of this or a little later time were one-decked
galleys with thirty oars, with seats and
shrines and the stern ornamented with figures of
animals. The cabin of those of royal or high
rank was a stately house, with roof and pillars,
sides brightly colored, in the fore, large paintings
and the stern a gigantic lotus. The blade of
the oar was like a bouquet of flowers with the
head of the king at top, the sails the richest cloth
of gay colors. A royal vessel of this description
belonged to King Thothmes III, Hatasu’s successor
and was called “Star of the two countries.”</p>

<p>Another description speaks of war ships having
the poop twisted, with armed mariners in
helmets of brass, with four short masts and on
each a large castle containing bowmen with steel-headed
arrows. Upon the prow a sort of fortress,
the soldiers carrying long spears and oval
shields decorated with hieroglyphics in brilliant
colors. Above the rowers large black Ethiopians
in steel cuirasses and long swords. The captains
in variegated armor and accompanied by a
thousand soldiers and three hundred rowers. The
prow ornamented with a lion’s head and colossal
shoulders across a broad gilded image of the
feathered globe of the sun, the emblem of Egypt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and the inscription, “Mistress of the World.”
But Hatasu’s fleet was going on a peaceful errand
and required no such panoply of war. Experienced
seamen managed it, while soldiers, ambassadors
and, some say, even ladies, accompanied
it and bore with them a variety of presents
to win the friendship and favor of the inhabitants
of this strange land. The envoys had
a small guard of soldiers, but all included did not
number more than two hundred and ten men.</p>

<p>The voyagers were met with a friendly welcome
and returned with stores of treasures. The
inhabitants of Punt lived in little round shaped
huts, built on stages and reached by ladders, all
under the shade of spreading palms. A picture
on the wall of the temple shows the prince of the
land Parihu by name, with his wife, Ati or Aty,
the latter fat and ungainly (though probably considered
a specimen of great beauty by her countrymen),
with a donkey to ride upon, followed
by two sons and a young daughter, the
last giving promise of rivaling her mother
in rotundity of outline. Gold, spices, ivory,
incense bearing trees, to the number of
thirty-one, precious gums, used in the service
of the temple, and various animals were
brought back to Egypt as a result of this most
successful journey. The return was celebrated
by a high festival in the temple. Hatshepsut or
Hatasu appeared in fullest royal attire, adorned
in the richest manner, a helmet on her head, a
spotted leopard skin covering her shoulders and
her limbs “perfumed like fresh dew.” She offered
incense to the god Amen, as his priestess, bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
two bowls full and weighing out gold with her
own hand. This was before the sacred boat of
Amen Ra, with a ram’s head at each end, and
carried by high priests, also in leopard skins. The
Naka, or incense bearing trees, were borne in
tubs, and the weights for weighing the precious
metals were gold rings in the shape of recumbent
oxen.</p>

<p>Later, as was his iconoclastic wont, Rameses II
destroyed some of these pictures and inscriptions
and inserted his own name.</p>

<p>Although the name of Tahutmes II, husband
and co-ruler with the queen, is not specially mentioned
in connection with this great expedition,
he shared in the after festival. He, too, designated
by his court name of King Menkhefer-ka-ra,
offered incense in the boat of Amen, carried
on the shoulders of men. “Thus,” says Miss
Edwards, “to the sound of trumpets and drums,
with waving of green boughs and shouts of triumph,
and followed by an ever gathering crowd,
the great procession takes its way between avenues
of sphinxes, past obelisks and pylons, and
up one magnificent flight of steps after another
till the topmost terrace of the Great Temple is
reached, where the Queen herself welcomed them
to the presence of Hathor, the Beautiful, the Lady
of the Western Mountain, the Goddess Regent
of the Land of Punt.”</p>

<p>At what period is not exactly known, but of
course earlier than this, since he is believed to
have designed the beautiful temple of Deir el
Bahri, the queen called to her assistance the services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of the architect Senmut, whose statue is in
the Berlin Museum. He, it is implied, usurped
the place in Hatasu’s affection which rightfully
belonged to her husband, but of this it is not possible
to speak with any degree of certainty or
authority. We only know that he was a man of
great ability in his own line, of intelligent mind
and skillful hand, and was highly appreciated by
her majesty. In an inscription in the Berlin Museum
he says his lady ruler made him “great in
both countries” and “chief of the chiefs” in the
whole of Egypt. The buildings which the queen
and he erected are said to be among the most
tasteful, complete and brilliant in the land. He
was of lowly birth, and therefore his position
was the more surprising. He appears to have
occupied in the queen’s counsels something of the
place of Disraeli to Queen Victoria, whose Jewish
origin made his occupancy of the position he
gained remarkable. After Senmut’s death Hatasu
raised to him a stone memorial as a token
of gratitude, with his portrait in black granite and
in an attitude of repose. On his shoulder were
the short but significant words, “there was not
found in writing his ancestors.” He is also introduced
in an inscription, as himself speaking,
where he used the male pronoun “he” in mentioning
the queen refers to his own services and
ends with styling her “the lord of the country,
the King of Makara.”</p>

<p>Senmut was evidently the chief counsellor and
favorite of Hatshepsut, but there was also another
highly regarded officer who shared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
or succeeded him in the queen’s favor and good
graces. This was a certain Aahmes, who had
also served her father, Thothmes, or Tahutmes
I, and whose tomb was discovered by Brugsch,
and bears this inscription, “I was during my existence
in the favor of the king, and was rewarded
by His Holiness, and a divine woman gave me
further reward, the defunct great queen Makara
(Hashop), because I brought up her daughter,
the great queen’s daughter, the defunct Nofrerura.”
It is of course plain that he survived the
queen, but we do not know whether he met with
equal favor at the hand of her successor. Possibly
the mother’s heart, little given to tenderness, may
have had an especial softness towards this “nurse”
or tutor of her dead child, her father’s trusted
servant and perhaps, on that very account, hers
also.</p>

<p>Two children were born to the queen, both
daughters, Neferura, the heiress, who is spoken
of as “the mistress of both lands,” who died in
the beginning of the reign of Tahutmes III, and
Hatasu Meri or Merytra, who it is estimated was
born about 1512 B. C. and became heiress
Princess, inheriting all her mother’s rights. To
establish the throne more firmly therefore, she
was married to Tahutmes III. This king was
long supposed to be the youngest son of Tahutmes I,
but the latest authorities, although they
do not speak with absolute assurance, incline to
believe he was the son of Tahutmes II, by a concubine,
hence he was in one case the uncle, and
in the other the half or step-brother of the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
princess, but with a less direct title to the throne
than she. A certain Renekheb is also spoken of
as a tutor of the young queen. This marriage
appears to have taken place when they were both
children and before the death of Tahutmes II,
which is proved by the cartouches of Tahutmes
II and Tahutmes III being found together upon
some of the monuments, and at the same time
suggests that the juvenile pair, nominally at least,
shared in the government.</p>

<p>Tahutmes II, born about 1533 B. C., appears
to have died at about thirty, in 1503, and some
writers maintain that Hatshepsut usurped the
power which rightfully belonged to Tahutmes III,
but Miss Edwards (ever ready to champion her
heroine) finds in the above fact strong proof that
the queen really protected the interests of her
young half-brother or nephew. While Petrie admits
that it would be unlikely and perhaps even
unnatural that a capable and ambitious woman,
still in the prime of life, should immediately hand
over the reins of government, placed in her hands
by her father, to a young and inexperienced boy
and justifies her retention of them, the more that
it was she and not he who had the stronger legal
claim. Be this as it may, if Tahutmes III owed
gratitude to Hatshepsut for care or protection he
showed her little return. Whether from the general
unpopularity of mothers-in-law, from her
treatment of his brother or uncle, from the feeling
that he was suppressed and kept in the background,
or from some unknown cause, he evidently
hated her. When he came into power he endeavored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to destroy the memorials of her from
off the earth and cause her memory even to be
forgotten. He injured or erased her name constantly
and whenever possible and substituted that
of his brother or himself.</p>

<p>Tahutmes I had continued the building of
Thebes and set up his two granite obelisks.
Tahutmes II and Hatshepsut continued building
at Karnak, the temple having been in existence, it
is said, as far back as the Eleventh Dynasty. So
gigantic was the scale on which these architectural
works were undertaken that one life seldom saw
their completion. Like the coral reef the temples
grew and were added to, monarch after monarch
of succeeding generations taking a share in the
general design.</p>

<p>Tahutmes I had raised at Karnak two obelisks
seventy feet in height, his daughter’s far outdid
them, for hers were the loftiest then known in
Egypt, a flawless block of red granite or rose
quartz, rising 108 or 109 feet into the air. This
was erected in the sixteenth year of her reign
and after the death of her husband, which took
place some dozen or more years after that of
his father. Probably the ceremonial mourning
was observed for him, but the heart of Hatshepsut
was hard and cold and even if we exonerate her
from the implication of being directly concerned
in his decease, which stands “not proven,” there
seems little doubt that she rejoiced to be comparatively
free and hold the reins of power exclusively
in her own hands. Nothing seemed missing from
her life or her pursuits, which she followed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
renewed energy and appeared more constantly
than ever in male attire, the short kilt and sandals,
the war helmet and even perhaps, as in her reproduction,
a beard. Architecture was evidently of
great interest to her as to many of her predecessors
and obelisks and temples still, after the
lapse of centuries, bear witness to her power and
skill.</p>

<p>It took nineteen months from its first inception
to the completion of her great obelisk and even
so, when one thinks of its magnificent proportions,
the work seems to have proceeded with wonderful
celerity. Inscriptions by Senmut record the
quarrying. Her brother’s name appears at the
side. One face was covered with gold, which the
queen is believed to have weighed out with her
own hand. The beautifully carved centre was inlaid
with electrum or silver gilt and related to herself.
“Amen-Khnum Hatasu, the golden Horus,
Lord of the two lands hath dedicated to her father,
Amen of Thebes, two obelisks of Maket stone
(red granite) hewn from the quarries of the
South. Their summits were sheathed with pure
gold, taken from the chiefs of all nations.”
“His Majesty gave these two gilded obelisks to
her father, Amen, that her name should live forever
in his temple,” and adds towards the conclusion,
“when Ra arises betwixt them as he journeys
upward from the heavenly horizon they flood
the two Egypts with the glory of their brightness.”
Rosellini says, speaking of the fineness of
the work, “every figure seems rather to have been
impressed with a seal than graven with a chisel.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
An inscription at the bottom states that it was
erected to her father, Tahutmes I. This obelisk,
with its mate, was to occupy a place in the centre
court of the palace at Karnak. Dr. Naville, the
explorer, discovered the burial chamber of Tahutmes
in 1893 and a great altar erected by the
queen.</p>

<p>In an inscription on part of the rock-cut temple
of Speos Artemidos, south Beni-hasan, reciting
her re-establishment of Egyptian power and worship
after destruction by the Hyksos, Hatshepsut
says: “The abode of the mistress of Qes (Kusae
on west side) was fallen in ruin, the earth had
covered her beautiful sanctuary and children
played over her temple—I cleared and rebuilt it
anew—I restored that which was in ruins and I
completed that which was left unfinished. For
there had been Amu in the midst of the Delta and
in Hanar and the foreign hoardes of their number
had destroyed the ancient works. They
reigned ignorant of the god Ra.”</p>

<p>The temple of Deir-el-Bahri or “Dayre-el-Bahari,”
its present Arabic name, was perhaps the
greatest work of Hatshepsut’s life and enough of
the ruins still remained for the clever French
architect, M. Brune, to reconstruct its plan for
us. The site was one that would have been chosen
by the Greeks for a theatre, but the Egyptian
dedicated it to what he deemed a higher object,
the worship of the gods. Situated on a green
plain, near the tombs of the kings of the Twelfth
Dynasty, it was a magnificent natural amphitheatre
on the shore of the river and, terrace by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
terrace, rose from the edge of the water to its
steep background of golden brown rock, in which
the inner temple, the “holy of holies,” was excavated.
Of its structure Senmut or Sen-Maut
was the presiding genius. The name “Dayre-el-Bahari”
means North church, or monastery, and
was, of course, applied to it in later times from
the ruins of an old monastery which was yet
young and modern beside the original erection.
An avenue of sphinxes connected the landing for
boats with the four terraces. These were supported
by earth-works and stone and guarded by
hawk-headed figures, in marble, bearing the
uraeus. Columns also supported it, some of them
polygonal in shape, with the head of the goddess
Hathor as a capitol, and were later restored and
kept in order till the time of the Ptolemies. “This
temple,” says one writer, “was a splendid specimen
of Egyptian Art history, whether we consider
the treatment of the stone or the richness of
the colored decorations,” and it was unique in
design and differed from all others. In the inner
recesses of the rock-cut chambers was a picture
of the queen, representing her as sucking the milk
of the sacred cow, the incarnation of the goddess
Hathor, thereby intimating her divine origin.</p>

<p>Some sixteen or seventeen years after the death
of Tahutmes II the cartouch of Tahutmes III becomes
associated with that of Hatshepsut and then
her brilliant career terminates, but the end is
wrapped in mystery. Whether she voluntarily
laid aside her royal power, which seems unnatural
and unlikely, whether she met with foul play or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
whether she died a natural death, we know not
The remains of many others of her family, more
or less illustrious, were found, but hers were not
among them. Her place of sepulture was discovered
by Mr. Rhind in 1841 in a cliff side near
her temple, but, strange to say, was again lost
sight of, and her successor, showing plainly his
feeling towards her, has constantly chiselled out
her name. A party of modern travelers, however,
claim to have rediscovered it.</p>

<p>Her cartouch, which may be seen in Baedaker
and other works, seems comparatively simple, beside
the more elaborate ones of other monarchs.
It is a circle with a dot in the centre, a small
seated female figure, wearing the plumes of a
goddess and below two right angles joined. The
three hieroglyphic signs are explained to mean
“Ma, the sitting figure of the goddess of Truth,
Law and Justice; Ka, represented by the hieroglyphic
of the uplifted arms and signifying Life, and
the sun’s disk, representing Ra, the supreme solar
god of the universe.”</p>

<p>Many memorials of this great queen, spite of
the efforts made to destroy them, remain to us.
The ruins of the temple, the great obelisks, one
of which is still standing, various statues and
statuettes, many sun-dried brick with her cartouch
and that of her father, some of which can be
seen in our own Metropolitan Museum in New
York, a cabinet in wood and ivory, her standard,
her signet ring in turquoise and gold, in the possession
of an English gentleman, and, most interesting
of all perhaps, the remains of her throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
chair, now in the British Museum. It is made of
a dark wood, not natural to Egypt, and probably
from the land of Punt. The legs are decorated
with ucilisks in gold, and the carven hoof
of some animal. The other parts are ornamented
with hieroglyphics in gold and silver and one
fragmentary royal oval in which the name of Hatasu
appears and thereby identifies the owner of
the throne.</p>

<p>Thus ends in comparative mystery, darkness
and silence this brilliant life, of which we were
long in ignorance.</p>

<p>Says Curtis in his charming “Nile Notes”:
“The history of Eastern life is embroidered to our
youngest eyes in that airy arabesque—an Eastern
book cannot be written without a dash of the
Arabian Nights—the East throughout hath that
fine flavor.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_10">CHAPTER TENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">MAUT-A-MUA.</span></h2>

<p>The great Hatasu was no more and after her
no woman held such extended and absolute sway.
The next queen whose name occurs at all prominently
is Maut-a-mua, or Maut-em-va, “Mother
of the boat,” wife of Tahutmes IV and mother of
Amenophis III. She appears to have held the
regency after her husband’s death till her son assumed
full power, or if not actually in this official
position, to have had great influence with him.
The tie between mother and son was a close one
and even his marriage did not seem to weaken it.</p>

<p>But before entering upon such fragmentary history
of her as remains to us it may be well to
enumerate briefly the lists of sovereigns which
connects Hatasu or Hatshepsut with her great
grandson’s or great nephew’s wife. Her half-brother
or step son-in-law, Tahutmes or Thothmes
III, sometimes called the Alexander of Egypt,
who succeeded or wrested the power from her
hands, had a long reign of fifty-three or fifty-four
years. Hatshepsut died at fifty-nine, and Tahutmes
III ascended the throne at thirty-one years
of age. The computation of his reign probably
dates from the time he was first associated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
his sister or stepmother in the regal power. He
was one of the most noted of the Egyptian kings,
laid aside the peace policy of his predecessors and
entered on a series of wars and conquests, marked
with many cruelties. The records of his military
expeditions are said to give us great insight into
the condition of Syria and Palestine about the
fifteenth century B. C. He, like his predecessor,
was interested in architecture, builded and added
to the temples and showed individual taste in his
additions. He has left more monuments behind
him than any of the Egyptian kings but Rameses
II. He built at Heliopolis, Memphis, Thebes,
Elephantine and nearly every town in Nubia.
Four of his obelisks have come down to us—one
in Rome, one in Constantinople, one in London
and one in New York. These last bear the popular
title of “Cleopatra’s needle,” though erected in
a much earlier time than the era of that renowned
queen. The first, “the greatest of all extant monoliths,”
is standing before the church of St. John
Lateran, at Rome. Many, many years were occupied
in its preparation. Obelisks were generally
erected in pairs and occasionally several of them
in succession formed an avenue. In the temple
of Deir el Bahri are pictures of Hatshepset and
Tahutmes III making offerings to the gods. Says
Baedaker: “On the upper part of the right wall is
a noteworthy scene. Makere, Hatshepsut I, Thutmosis
III, and the Princess Ranofru sacrificing
to the boat of Ammon, behind which stands Thutmosis
I with his consort, Aahmes, and their little
daughter, Binofru. A similar scene was represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
above the recess on the left wall; the kneeling
Thutmosis III and the Princess Binofra may
still be distinguished.” The statues of Tahutmes
III are numerous, but not colossal.</p>

<p>He “took to wife” in the old Eastern phrase,
Hatasu-Meri, daughter of the great Hatshepsut
and his own near relative, but our knowledge of
her is extremely limited. She evidently did not
inherit her mother’s characteristics and possibly
did not live any great length of time. Or if her
husband transferred to her any portion of the dislike
which he so evidently bore her mother he
may have purposely kept her in the background,
but in any case she cannot be looked upon as an
assertive character. Her second name is given as
Meri or Merira and there is a picture of her on
a throne behind, not beside, her husband. She is,
however, attired as a goddess, with whip, ankh
and tall plumes. This is at Medinet Habu; again
she is spoken of as Meryt-ra Hatshepset, mother
of Amenophis II, and a scene in a tomb represents
her, accompanied by her son. A female
sphinx representing her with her husband’s name
inscribed was found in the temple of Isis and is
now in the Baracco collection at Rome and casts
are at Turin and Berlin. One inscription, and
possibly more, remain, however, speaking of her
as “beloved consort,” or some other form expressing
a degree of affection, but at this late period
it is impossible to determine whether it was
the usual conventional phrase or had some
foundation in truth. She lived and died, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
whether her life was a long and happy one or short
and sorrowful we cannot tell.</p>

<p>The reign of Tahutmes III is among the longest
in history. It was, however, exceeded by some
monarchs, Louis XIV, seventy-two years. George
III and Queen Victoria over sixty, Henry III occupied
the throne fifty-six years, Edward III fifty,
and there was also one of the Mogul Emperors, as
well as others. A glass vase in the British Museum,
said to be the oldest in existence, bears
the name of Tahutmes III. There are various
mementoes or memorials of him in different
places, the most personal perhaps, his coffin, much
damaged and stripped of its gilding, which may
be seen in the Gizeh Museum.</p>

<p>Amenophis or Amenhotep II, son probably of
Hatasu-Meri, succeeded his father. Of him also
we read as a warrior and a cruel one, bringing
back the bodies of several kings whom he had
slain with his own hand. The Egyptians were
said not to be so cruel in battle as the Assyrians,
but there seems little to choose between them.
There is a picture of Amenophis II on the wall at
Abd-el-Gurneh, as a child on the lap of a nurse,
the heads and backs of five Asiatics serving him
as a footstool, implying doubtless that he himself
would be, or his father before him had been, a
warrior and a conqueror. There is also a kneeling
statue of him, in later life, holding a globular
vase in his hand. He succeeded to the throne
when young, perhaps at eighteen, and his reign
was comparatively short as was that of his son
and successor, Tahutmes IV. His queen was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
named Ta-aa and is recorded on a double statue
of her and her son, Tahutmes IV. She is called
“royal mother and wife,” showing her to be his
mother. We knew less of her than of almost any
of the queens, that she continued the royal line
and her name seems but brief record of her.</p>

<p>Of Tahutmes IV it is said that he spent much
time in youth in hunting and field sports. He
married Mautamua, or Maut-em-va, or as she is
again spoken of, Moutetemarait, possibly an Ethiopian
princess. Various inter-marriages, as in
modern times not unfrequently, making the families
in adjacent kingdoms near of kin.</p>

<p>The name of Tahutmes IV is especially associated
with the great Sphinx and we cannot doubt
the whole matter was of much interest to the
queen also. The god Harmaehis appeared to the
king in a dream and promised him his special
favor if he would dig out the Sphinx which bore
his image and lay half buried in the sand. The
monarch obeyed, restored and repaired the grand
monument and built a temple at its base. This
stands between the two extended paws, on one of
which the king’s name has been found inscribed.
It was an open temple with an altar and on the
breast of the colossus was the memorial stone
with the king’s name, made of red granite.</p>

<p>Dreams seem to have borne a special art in the
family history. The queen also had a noted
dream. It was said that she was sleeping in the
most beautiful room in the palace and awoke and
saw her husband by her side. Then a few moments
after the figure of the god Amen appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and, when she cried out in alarm, he predicted
the birth of her son and vanished in clouds of
sweet perfume. Hence the young king was considered
in a sense the son of the god. Mautamua
is elsewhere called a princess of Mitanni and
seems to have been won with difficulty by the
young Egyptian prince or kin. One of the tablets
found says: “When the father of Nimmuriya
(Tahutmes IV) sent to Artotama my grandfather
and asked for his daughter to wife, my grandfather
refused his request, and though he sent the
fifth time and the sixth time he would not give
her to him. It was only after he had sent the
seventh time that he gave her to him, being compelled
for many reasons.” This was among the
noted collection of the Tel-el-Amarna tablets and
is believed by late authorities to refer to Queen
Maut-amua, who is also spoken of as the divine
wife and mother.</p>

<p>The queen’s home was in Thebes, which had
succeeded Memphis as the great city of the Empire,
standing, it is said, to Ethiopia and Egypt
“in the relation occupied by Rome to Mediæval
Christianity, the capital sacerdotal city of all who
worshipped the god Amen.” On the wall of what
is called the “Birth Room” at the temple of Luxor
are various reliefs relating to the birth of Amenophis
III, showing Queen Maut-a-mua, the
nurses, the goddess Isis and others. In one the
Queen, after the birth of her son (Ra-ma-neb), is
seen kneeling on a kind of dais. The goddess
Hathor kneels facing her with the babe in her
arms. The Ka of both are repeated, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
double figures, and the sacred cow suckles the
child. For some reason, not given, Amenophis
III was particularly rich in Ka names, for he had
seven. Another relief shows Hathor presenting
the child to the goddess Safekh, and to Amen-Ra,
the god of Thebes. Behind Amen-Ra stands the
god Nilus and behind him another carrying three
ankhs or life signs for the family, throne and Ka
name. Safekh dips her pen in ink to record his
birth; the royal and Ka ovals are inscribed above.
Says Miss Edwards: “Each sovereign on succeeding
to the throne not only assumed a throne name,
but took also a name for his Ka. The throne name
was enclosed in a royal oval, or cartouch, like the
family name, but the Ka name was represented
as if inscribed above the false doorway, just where
the name of a deceased person would be inscribed
above the actual door of his sepulchre.”</p>

<p>As the goddess Safekh was the patron deity
of libraries we may judge that the king had intellectual
tastes, though we know him to have
been something of an athlete and a great sportsman.
Indeed, it was to this last that he owed
his wife, for it was on a hunting expedition that
he encountered and fell in love with her. Queen
Maut-amua and her daughter-in-law, Ti or Thi,
were associated much together, as were Queen
Aahotep and her daughter-in-law, Nefertari-Aahmes,
though not so generally considered divinities
as were the founders of the race.</p>

<p>Maut-a-mua must have been a woman of intellect,
capacity and attraction since she was her
son’s guardian, and probably regent, and his attachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to her seems to have been strong and
enduring. She lived many years after her husband,
whose reign was brief, lasting not more
than eight or nine years.</p>

<p>The likenesses of these various kings and queens
are often found among the wall pictures in the
tombs and are reproduced in many of the books on
Egypt. The bas-reliefs and statues which decorated
temples and tombs were mostly painted.
Says Maspero: “That the Egyptians studied from
Nature is proved by the facility with which they
seized likenesses and drew the appropriate movements
of animals. These figures are strange, but
they live and have a certain charm.” To paint
men brown and women yellow was the rule, but
to this there were occasional exceptions. At Sackuarah,
in the time of the Fifth Dynasty, the flesh
tint of the men is yellow, while at Istamboul, or
Abu Simbel, it is red, as also in the tombs of the
epoch of Thotmosis IV.</p>

<p>The early Egyptian is said to have had a fine
forehead, small, aquiline nose and a well-formed
chin. The picture preserved of Queen Maut-a-mua,
with the royal asp above her forehead, gives
a long, slightly aquiline nose and a small, well-shaped
chin. It is rather startling, in turning to
her daughter-in-law, Ti, to find this face repeated
in a sort of caricature, devoid of beauty. As in
most cases, doctors differ as to the amount of reliance
that can be placed upon the verisimilitude
of the portraits and statues of these various kings
and queens that have come down to us. Some
authorities maintain that there existed an ideal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
conventional type, to which the actual bore little or
no resemblance, and point out how each is but the
modification of the other. Some again claim for
them considerable authenticity. Perhaps a middle
ground may come nearest to the truth. The conventional
type no doubt dominated the painter’s or
sculptor’s mind. But when the statues are proved
to have been executed in the lifetime of the original
it seems likely that some resemblance was
aimed at, and the differences that exist go to
show this. Also in many cases they belonged to
the same family, and may well have had features
common to all; as in later times the Hapsburgh
jaw was handed down from generation to generation.
How hard we have found it to reconcile
the picture in the various galleries with the reputation
of the charming, beautiful and unhappy
Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, and yet doubtless
there was a resemblance. How often, too, the
photograph of a near and dear friend has an utterly
unfamiliar aspect. So that we may fairly
admit that even in these ancient times statues and
pictures (at least in some cases) a suggestion
of the original may remain to us.</p>

<p>The head of Tahutmes IV, which is preserved
in a statue or statuette, gives a pleasing face, with
an amiable expression. At Luxor, Queen Maut-a-mua
appears without the king, but with her son,
whose paternity is ascribed to Amen. There is
also a picture of the king, smiting some negroes,
and behind is a queen called Ai’at who is spoken
of as royal daughter, sister and wife, but it is
thought this may be intended for an id<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>eograph of
the “goddess queen,” Maut-a-mua, as there is no
other trace of her. On one private tomb is a
picture of Amenophis III and his mother, and
there are also various small remains in the way
of scarabs, rings, etc. In one of the reliefs in
the “Birth Room,” before referred to, the god
Amen and the queen are seated upon the hieroglyphic
symbol for heaven and supported by the
goddesses Selqet and Neith.</p>

<p>King Amenophis III did not resemble his
mother. It is quite a different face, with good
features and a resolute, though pensive expression.
The forehead is high, the eyes full, the
nose long but rounded at the end, the upper lip
short, and the chin prognathous. He is described
as amiable and generous, and showed deference
and strong affection both for mother and wife.
He seems among the most pleasing of the
Egyptian kings. Engaged in wars, devoted to
hunting, especially the chase of the lion, which
led him far afield, he was yet, as were many of
his predecessors, deeply interested in architectural
enterprises and the era is noted for the spirit and
beauty of its sculpture. Court and colonnade at
Karnak were of his building, and on the walls of
various apartments are pictures of the coronation
of the king and other details of his life.</p>

<p>He is best known to us, and his fame rests
chiefly on the marvellous colossi which he erected,
“the grandest the world has ever seen.” They
are sixty feet high, and when they wore the crown
of an Egyptian king, which has since been destroyed,
towered seventy feet into the air, a solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
block of sandstone. Miss Martineau, a traveller
of comparatively modern times, thus describes the
impression they made upon her. “There they
sit, together yet apart, in the midst of the plain,
serene and vigilant, still keeping their untired
watch over the lapse of ages and the eclipse of
Europe. I can never believe that anything else
so majestic as this pair has been conceived of by
the imagination of Art, nothing certainly, even in
Nature, ever affected me so unspeakably. The
pair, sitting alone amid the expanse of verdure,
with islands of ruins behind them, grow more
striking to us every day. The impression of
sublime tranquility which they convey, when seen
from distant points, is confirmed by a nearer approach.
There they sit, keeping watch, hands on
knees, gazing straight forward, seeming, though
so much of the face is gone, to be looking over
to the monumental piles on the other side of the
river, which became gorgeous temples after these
throne seats were placed here—the most immovable
thrones that have ever been established on
the earth.”</p>

<p>It is rarely that the name of an Egyptian sculptor
is preserved, but this case is an exception. An
inscription records his name and his naturally
proud and exultant feelings at the completion of
his work. He was called Amen-hotep or Amen-hept,
and thus speaks: “I immortalized the name
of the king and no one has done the like of me
in my works. I executed two portrait statues of
the king, astonishing for their breadth and height,
their completed form dwarfed the temple tower;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
forty cubits was their measure: they were cut in
the splendid sandstone mountain, on either side
the eastern and the western, I caused to be built
lightships whereon the statues were carried up the
river; they were emplaced in their sublime temple;
they will last as long as heaven. A joyful event
was it when they were landed at Thebes and
raised up in their place.”</p>

<p>The stone is of a yellowish brown color and
very difficult to work. Both statues represent
the king and stood before a temple which he built,
but of which the veriest fragments remain.
We are reminded somewhat by the sculptor’s
triumphant pæan of the good Un’e, who was minister
to Pepi VI and so exulted in his work and
position. Fond as Amenophis was of both his
mother and his foreign wife, for whose pleasure
and diversion he constructed a great lake, neither
of them sit beside him or share the honor of so
majestic a statue, as we might suppose, especially
as regards his wife, would have been the case; he
immortalizes himself alone. Two figures of
queens, Maut-a-mua and Ti, are, however sculptured
at the base of the statues; they measure
eighteen feet in height, but appear small beside
the colossi. Says one visitor, the surface of the
statues was originally beautifully polished. The
thrones on which they are seated are covered with
sculptures; the god Hapi (the Nile) is weaving
together the lotus lily and papyrus plant, implying
the rule of the monarch over Upper and
Lower Egypt.</p>

<p>Homer calls Amenophis III, the Memnon of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the Greeks, “the most stately of living men,” and
according to a later legend he was the son of
Aurora. It was during the Roman imperial epoch
that they were taken for the statues of Memnon,
who slew Nestor’s son, Antiochus, in the Trojan
war, and was himself slain by Achilles, and to
explain the fact that the Trojan hero should thus
appear in Egypt a legend was invented. The so-called
“vocal Memnon,” the more Eastern of the
statues, greeted his mother, Eos, with musical
sounds and the morning dews were supposed
to be the tears which the goddess shed upon her
beloved child. The two statues stood at the end
of an avenue of gigantic figures, leading to the
temple of Amen, and from the river to the temple,
a mile in length, went the Strada Regia, the royal
street of Thebes.</p>

<p>Says our own Curtis, who has written so charmingly
of his Egyptian experiences: “Yearly comes
the Nile humbly to his feet, and leaving them pays
homage. Then receding slowly leaves water
plants wreathed around the throne, on which he
is sculptured as a good genius harvesting the
lotus, and brings a hundred travellers to perpetuate
the homage. These sublime sketches in stone
are an artist’s work. In those earlier days Art
was not content with the grace of Nature, but
coped with its proportions. Vain attempts, but
glorious!” The fact of this musical note being
heard from “the darling of the dawn” is recorded
on the base of the statue, and is mentioned by
Strabo, the elder Pliny and many others. Sandy
beaches sometimes emit musical sounds and something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
in the structure of the rock, warmed by the
rays of the rising sun, may have caused the sounds
to be heard, or they may have been produced by
artificial means, at the instance of the priests,
striving to impress the people. The true origin
of the mystery was never discovered, though its
existence seems well attested, and eventually the
sounds ceased, probably as the result of an earthquake
or the restoration of the figures which was
undertaken by a later king. Another theory lays
the injury of the statues at the door of Cambyses,
who was credited with all possible crimes, and a
sculptured inscription reads: “I wrote after having
heard Memnon. Cambyses has wounded me.
A stone cut into the image of the sun-king. I had
once the sweet voice of Memnon, but Cambyses
has deprived me of the accents which express joy
and grief.”</p>

<p>The sounds are said by some authorities to have
been heard during a period of two hundred and
twenty years. Travellers in ancient times (like
the modern vandal) were very fond of scribbling
their names on monuments, which should be held
in more respect, and a number of these, including
some of their remarks and silly verses, have been
found on the base of the statue and refer to the
sounds. At the time of their erection the level
of the Nile was evidently different from that of
the present day for its waters, as Curtis has said,
now occasionally leave the feet of the giant pair.</p>

<p>Amenophis III began quarrying stone for his
numerous architectural works in the first and second
years of his reign from quarries near Silseleh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and his palace was said to resemble that subsequently
built by his son at Tel-el-Amarna in some
respects. Scarabs bearing the name of this king
are to be seen in our own New York Museum, as
also in various other places, but those of Tahutmes
III are still more frequent here. The tomb of
Amenophis III was found in the west valley of
the Tombs of the Kings by a French expedition.</p>

<p>Queen Maut-a-mua had the pleasure, we may
believe, of seeing a number of grandchildren, as
Amenophis III had four sons and three daughters,
if not others unmentioned, and so kindly seem to
have been the family relations that we may perhaps
picture her with her son’s wife in the midst
of the home circle spoiling them quite like a modern
grandmother. Up to this period the men of
the family appear to have been a stalwart, good-looking
race, while the women probably possessed
more beauty than their pictures would lead us to
infer. Of the general outline of their history we
have some knowledge, but seldom or never can we
definitely place the day of their birth or that of
their death. So at what exact period Queen
Maut-a-mua passed away we cannot state, only
we may believe she was watched over by filial affection
to the last, was buried amid tears and
lamentations, and had all due funeral rites observed,
even if she was not numbered among
those royalties who were specially regarded as divinities,
the founders of the race, and to whom
divine honors were subsequently paid, yet is she
occasionally spoken of as “the goddess queen.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_11">CHAPTER ELEVENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">TYI.</span></h2>

<p>With Queen Tyi (or as her name is variously
spelled, Ti, Tai, Tity, Tii, Teye, Tuaa, Thua)
we again consider the story of a woman of unusual
power, and though not leaving such indelible
impression upon the page of history as did
Queen Hatasu, her influence was strongly felt.
Both as wife and mother we see the traces of her
ideas and wishes on the actions of husband and
son; both, evidently, turned to her for counsel and
each in his own way showed her devoted affection.
So potent was her sway over the latter that to it
is largely attributed the religious and political
revolution which occurred in the lifetime of
Amenophis IV. Though its effects were comparatively
temporary and passed away during the
reign of his successors for the time being it convulsed
Egypt to its centre and the records of it
have not been obliterated by the lapse of centuries.</p>

<p>Amenophis III, son of Tahutmes IV and
Maut-a-mua, was, we judge, an attractive youth.
He had a fine presence, an agreeable expression
and an amiable and generous disposition, while
his love story holds more of romance than usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
falls to the lot of kings or queens. He is credited
with a number of wives or less reputable connections.
Perhaps they included the errors of the
“sowing of wild oats,” and at any rate seem to
have been relegated to or kept in the background
by a devoted affection for the lady who became
pre-eminently his legal wife. These various wives
are given as a sister and two daughters of Kalima-Sin,
King of Karaduniyash, and a sister and
daughter of Tushratta, King of Mittani, none of
whom, it is said, were acknowledged queen of
Egypt, while other records seem to imply that
Queen Tyi was the daughter of Tushratta of
Dushratta, King of Mittanni. A letter to Babylon
seems to show that Amenophis III had married
a Babylonish princess, and that her brother, Kali-masin,
was not satisfied about her safety, but was
reassured by Amenophis. A match between another
princess of that country and the Egyptian
sovereign seems to have failed for lack of sufficient
gold on the lady’s part. Wars also interfered
with connubial arrangements.</p>

<p>Another account says that Amenophis III
haughtily refused when the King of Mesopotamia,
Kalima-Sin, wished to marry one of the Egyptian
princesses, saying that the daughter of the king
of the Land of Egypt had never been given to a
“nobody.” This, of course, occurred later, if at
all, and it seems not quite reasonable that the king
himself should take a princess as his wife from
the same family to which he refused his daughter.
The sovereign of great Egypt evidently viewed
with contempt the claims of these petty princes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to be considered in any way his equal. Yet one
letter in the collection found at Tel-el-Amarna
shows that Tahutmes III, Tahutmes IV and
Amenophis IV all married Mitannian princesses.
After such a lapse of time and among conflicting
statements it is hard to arrive at the absolute facts,
but as our present concern is chiefly with Queen
Tyi it matters the less. She alone of these various
ladies has a distinct personality and takes a prominent
place.</p>

<p>Hunting was, with Amenophis III, a passion,
the hunting of the lion a royal sport, for the sake
of which he journeyed far and no doubt underwent
many enforced privations. It must have
been in the heyday of youth and manly vigor that,
on one of his long expeditions, he encountered
the foreign princess who at once won his heart
and probably reciprocated to a more than ordinary
degree the affection she inspired. Spite of the
rather unattractive effigies which bear her name,
we must believe that she was beautiful and winning,
since for her sake he cast aside the so frequent
custom of marriage with a sister or some
home dignitary and invited her to share his
throne.</p>

<p>Probably then, or later, the queen participated
in the favorite amusement of her husband, not
wanting in courage for the perils or hardships involved,
nor did she shrink as a more sensitive
female of later times might have done from what
was painful, cruel or revolting in the death throes
of the mighty beast.</p>

<p>Scarabs, so often used by the Egyptians to record<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
events which they considered of importance,
have been found, bearing such inscriptions as this:
“Amenhotep, prince of Thebes, giver of life, and
royal spouse Thi. In respect of lions, brought
Majesty his from shooting his own, beginning
from year first to year tenth, lions fierce 102.”</p>

<p>These scarabs, giving the names of gods, kings
and singers are often most valuable in filling gaps
in other records. The most frequently found are
those of Tahutmes III, of which there are a number
in the Metropolitan Museum in New York;
Amenophis III, Seti I and Rameses II, and they
are inscribed with the names of kings from Mena
to the Roman Emperor Antoninus. Hence on
those known to be of a particular period and
found with the royal mummies, the name of much
earlier kings are frequently traced. Scarabs were
copied by the Phoenicians and are imitated in
these modern times in Egypt. The work, at first
very clumsy, has gradually become better executed,
while the real ones have, of course, grown
dearer as well as rarer.</p>

<p>A brief enumeration of some of the scarabs relating
to these periods to be seen in the New York
Museum may not be without interest. One of
Tahutmes or Thothmes III has the figure of the
god Bes in the centre, flanked by cartouches of
the king a winged scarab below and obscure ornamentation
above. The color of the composition
of which it is made a faded reddish brown. Another
of soft blue stone or paste has the pre-nomen
of the same king called “subduer of foreigners in
all lands.” One of green porcelain, beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
executed, shows a squatting figure with extended
arms, upholding the divine boat, and above, the
pre-nomen of King Thothmes. Inscriptions are
“the good god” and “lord of both lands,” while
the ankh, or life sign, is both behind the body and
attached to the knees. On another of grey composition,
above a horse, chariot and charioteer, is
the pre-nomen of the king, in a cartouch, with the
ends reversed. A bead or seal of hard, green
stone has on the one side the pre-nomen of
Thothmes III, with the Tet sign below, each
flanked by uraei, and on the reverse a Hathor-headed
sistrum also flanked by uraei. A cartouch
of Amenophis III and the symbol of “truth” is on
a scarab of green and brown pottery. Another
has “Praise of Amenophis III.” His cartouch and
“lord of might” is on one of green pottery, while
a scarab in grey composition, beautifully executed
bears the pre-nomen of the king on both sides,
with a winged beetle and disk flanked by uraei and
a human headed sphinx with the words, “Living
god Tum.” Most interesting of all, however, in
connection with the present chapter, is a green
pottery scaraboid, symbolic eye, bearing the words
“The royal wife Tii,” wife of Amenohotep III.</p>

<p>Melville has graphically described the setting
forth of a royal hunt, in another ancient kingdom,
which, in some particulars at least, may reproduce
the Egyptian pageant. “A queen and all
her glittering train defiled from the lofty porches
of Babylon the Great, with tramp of horses and
ring of bridle, with steady footfalls of warriors,
curled, bearded, erect and formidable, with ponderous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
tread of stately elephants, gorgeous in
trappings of scarlet, pearl and gold, with stealthy
gait of meek-eyed camels, plodding patient with
their burdens in the rear. Scouring into the waste
before that jewelled troop of wild asses bruised
and broke the shoots of wormwood beneath their
flying hoofs, till the hot air was laden with an
aromatic smell, the ostrich spread her scant and
tufted wings to scud before the wind, tall, swift,
ungainly, in a cloud of yellow dust; the fleet
gazelle, with beating heart and head, tucked back,
sprang forward like an arrow from the bow,
never to pause nor stint in her terror-stricken
flight, till man and horse, game and hunter were
left hopelessly behind—far down beyond the unbroken
level of the horizon. But the monarch of
the desert, the grim and lordly lion, sought no
refuge in flight, accepted no compromise of retreat.
Driven from his covert he might move
slowly and sullenly away, but it was to turn in
savage wrath on the eager horseman who approached
too near, or the daring archer who ventured
to bend his bow within point-blank distance
of such an enemy. Nevertheless, even the fiercest
of their kind must yield before man, the conqueror
of beasts, before woman, the conqueror of man,
and on the shaft which drank his life blood and
transfixed the lion from side to side was graven
the royal tiara of a monarch’s mate.”</p>

<p>Amid such scenes sped the wooing, and no
doubt in later years passed many exciting hours.
Amenophis or Amenhotep III reared young lions
as pets, and also presented live ones as gifts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the temples, estimating them as of great value,
though we may wonder in what special manner
they could be of profit, service or pleasure there.</p>

<p>The pictures of Queen Tyi, or Tai, in the tombs
of the Queens, near Thebes, and in other places,
copied by Champollion and Rosellini show her
with blue eyes, a skin of pinkish hue, like a Northern
maiden, and a pleasing expression. Many of
the queens were buried in a valley behind the
temple of Medinet Haboo at Thebes others were
laid beside their lords. Tyi, as has been said, was
considered by some to be the daughter of a
Mesopotamian, Asiatic, Dashratta or Tushratta,
king of Mitanni, Maten of the hieroglyphics.
Other authorities, from cuneiform tablets found
at Tel-el-amarna, give her paternity as that of a
sister of or daughter of Kalimma Sin, king of
Koraduniyash, probably a county northeast of
Syria. Kings and queens of Babylon claimed
Amenophis III as a new kinsman, perhaps as the
result of this marriage.</p>

<p>Scarabs were engraved in honor of the union
and part of a scarab gives the record “Amenhetep,
prince of Thebes, giver of life and royal spouse
mighty lady Thi, living one—the name of father
her (was) Tuaa or Juaa, the name of mother her
(was) Thuau, the wife to wit of the king powerful.
Frontier his South is as far as Kerei, land of
Nubia, frontier North is as far as Netharina
(Mesopotamia).” Part of another reads, “A wonderful
thing they brought to Majesty his, life,
strength, health, the daughter of the prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Mesopotamia, Sotharna. Kirkipa and the chiefs
of women her 300 + 10 + 7.” The mummies of
her parents have been recently found.</p>

<p>Many of these scarabs are preserved in the
Museums of Gizeh, Berlin and other places. An
enamelled vase in different colors in the Gizeh
Museum also bears the name of Amenophis III
and Tyi, a potsherd, in one of the older museums
gives the coronation date of Amenophis III as
“the 13th day of the month Epiphi,” said to correspond
in part to our April and May, which,
without this otherwise valueless fragment we
might perhaps never have known.</p>

<p>Queen Tyi was attended as the scarab notes, by
three hundred and seventeen women, which
would of course imply a force of male protectors
as well. A very precious bride. This may recall
the story in the Talmud about Abraham, who
on approaching Egypt locked Sarah in a chest to
hide her dangerous beauty. The custom officers
asked if he carried clothes. He answered, “I will
pay for clothes.” Then they raised their demand,
“Thou carriest gold?” To this he also agreed and
further to the price of the finest silks and precious
stones. Finding they could name nothing of
greater value than he held his treasure they at
last insisted that he should open the box and the
tale ends “the whole of Egypt was illuminated
with the lustre of Sarah’s beauty.” Whether
Queen Tyi’s beauty thus surprised and delighted
the people of her new home we can only surmise,
but at least she was deemed precious enough to
be well served and guarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>So the bond was sealed between the royal lovers
and away from her own land journeyed the newly
elected queen. A woman with a fair face and
figure, a heart keenly responsive to human affections,
with a deep-seated faith in the religion of
her fore-fathers, worshippers of the sun, and, perhaps
even at that early period, a quiet determination
that she would win her husband and his people
from what she must have deemed the error of
their ways, their worship of so many gods under
the form of beasts and birds, introduce a purer,
simpler religion among them. Something of the
spirit of Joan of Arc may have animated her;
something of the religious fervor of an Ursula
and her eleven thousand virgins (or was it only
eleven martyrs, the M being mistaken for a thousand?)
as the one girded herself for battle and
the other took up her pious pilgrimage.</p>

<p>We know less of the formalities necessary for
the conclusion of a royal marriage among the
Egyptians than we do of their funeral rites and
ceremonies. The latter as ushering them into a
new and higher existence were deemed the more
important and of greater concern to both the present
generation and to posterity, especially the latter,
and its records and momentoes tell the story
a thousand times, but we may take for granted
that many observances, both civil and religious,
marked the union of man and woman, in particular
those of nobles and kings. Some authorities
have questioned Queen Tyi’s claim to royal birth,
but the retinue of attendants and servants that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
accompanied her leave little doubt that she was a
princess of note.</p>

<p>This bridal train may recall another of later
times, that of Henrietta Maria of France, as she
journeyed to meet her future husband, Charles I
of England. She, too, was attended by a large
retinue: she, too, held strongly a different faith
and more or less, on that account, awakened the
prejudices of her new subjects, and she, too, was
involved in a revolution, partly religious in character.
But here the parallel ends, for the one
remained in possession of her power, while the
other was driven from her throne and became an
exile.</p>

<p>Perhaps the new queen was taken at once to her
palace, the remains of which were discovered by
Greaut at Malgata, and which, after being pillaged,
were subsequently excavated by Newberry
and Titus. Or she may have watched its erection
with interest, after her arrival. The original edifice
is thus described by those who have made a
careful study of the fragmentary remains. “The
plan of the palace seems to have been quite similar
to that of the palace which Amenophis IV
erected for himself in Tel-el-Amarna, and which
was several years ago explored by Petrie. In
the palace of Amenophis III the rooms were likewise
adorned by beautifully decorated stucco
floors, and the roof were supported by columns.
The walls were embellished with stucco work, the
representations, in part, setting forth every-day
life. In addition to staterooms, working rooms,
the kitchen with its storage closets, a faience factory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in which the different amulets and ornaments
were made, can be distinguished. Not far
from the palace was found an altar, built of tile,
and at one time probably wainscotted with slabs
of stone. It was quite similar to the one in the
temple of Deir-el-Bahri, and this one was certainly
dedicated to the sun-god. As the altars of
ancient Israel most likely also had a similar form,
these remains of the old Egyptian cultus have an
especial Biblical interest.” The columns of the
great temple and likely of the palace also, were
sculptured to resemble the buds of the lotus, sometimes
called the Egyptian immortelle, which
might also be called the national flower, so highly
was it regarded and so constantly was it used as
a model for architectural designs.</p>

<p>That the foreign daughter-in-law was kindly
received by Queen Maut-a-mua we may well believe
from the harmony which seemed to exist
between them later and the union of their two
statues with that of Amenophis III; while in her
turn Queen Tyi, when she occupied the same position,
extended a like friendly affection to her
son’s wife.</p>

<p>The influence of the new queen was soon perceived
in the institution, by the king, of a religious
festival in honor of the sun’s disk. Many
of the people may have been charmed to have anything
like another holiday, with its attendant
pageants and observances, added to their list, but
there can be little doubt that it awakened the suspicion
of the priests, who jealously guarded the
ancient faith and beheld with disfavor anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
that might involve less devotion to the numerous
gods which they worshipped and of whose interests
they were the guardians, and any change
that might minimize their influence or deplete the
resources in the treasuries of the temples.</p>

<p>Queen Tyi seems not to have been popular.
She was a foreigner, which in itself often awakens
an antagonistic feeling, amusingly illustrated in
the story of the English laborer who when told
that a passer by was a stranger exclaimed, “Eave
alf a brick at im’.” She held a different faith
and in all probability the priests with a consciousness
of her latent or expressed views and principles
used their great influence quietly to set the
people against her and this dislike was transferred
to her son.</p>

<p>But to her husband she was ever a first consideration.
The records give an account of an
enterprise which he early undertook for her pleasure.
This was the construction of a large artificial
lake on which she might sail or row at will.
Again the scarabs chronicle this tribute of connubial
tenderness, and again we see the queen’s
religious views considered. It begins as usual
with an ascription to the gods. “Under the majesty
of Horus the golden, mighty of valor, full
power, diademed with law (lord of the North and
South) establisher of laws, pacifier of the two
lands. Horus, the golden, mighty of valor, smiter
of foreign lands. Ordered majesty his the oaking
of a lake for the royal spouse, mighty lady Thi.
Length its (was) cubits 3000-6000, breadth its
cubits 600. Made majesty his festival of the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of the waters on month third of sowing
day sixteenth. Sailed majesty in his boat ‘Atenneferu’
‘Disk of beauties’ or ‘the most beautiful
disk.’” He sailed across to inaugurate the opening
and perhaps to show her that all was safe
and well and then doubtless the queen held sway
over it, permitting only such as she chose to share
the pleasure with her and perhaps making it a
mark of special favor when she did so. The
Egyptians held many of their religious festivals
on the Nile and this lake may have been specially
devoted to such religious observances as the queen
wished to hold in honor of the celestial god whom
she worshipped. The place selected for this feat
of engineering skill was near the town of Tarucha.</p>

<p>The remains of a beautiful temple at Sideruga,
built by Amenophis III to or for Queen Tyi, have
also been found and an inscription says Amenhotep
“made his monuments for the great and
mighty heiress, the mistress of all lands, Tyi.”
A group of the king and Tyi is in the Summa
collection and an inscription reads: “Amen’nekht,
princess, prays with her mother before Amenhotep III,
because he praises her beautiful face
and honors her beauty.” A Usheti box in the
Berlin Museum bears the name of Tyi and the
monuments of her are numerous. She is by the
colossi of her husband and appears with him in
official scenes at Saleb. The figure sculptured in
the tomb of Huy at Tel-el-Amarna, on a scarab,
etc., is shown seated; her name alone appears in
a quarry at the same place, after her husband’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
death. And her parents are named as Yoman
and Thuaa.</p>

<p>The additions made by Amenophis III to the
long list of Egyptian temples are among the most
noted. He built the oldest part of the Serapeum
at Sakkarah, the temple of Amen-Ra at Karnak
and also at Luxor a sanctuary with surrounding
chambers, a pro-naos or hall with four columns,
and another large court (which was evidently
used afterwards as a place of worship by the
early Christians), and a noble hypostycle court
with four rows of lofty columns bearing the lotus
capital. At the end nearest the sanctuary on
either side are double rows of the same columns,
then a huge pilon, and in front of all, a noble
avenue of fourteen still more massive and lofty
columns bearing the lotus-flower capital. This
avenue with the usual pylon appears to have completed
the Temple of Amenophis III. About
1600 B. C. is the date sometimes set for this
work. An avenue of Sphinxes connected the two
temples. The temple of Mut at Karnak was
Amenophis’ special work. At el Kab there is also
a beautiful little temple or chapel built by him
containing various pictures of the king making
offerings to the gods, etc. Other works might be
named as well as the grand statues already referred
to.</p>

<p>As devoted as was Amenophis III to the god
Amen, on whose temples he lavished gifts and
to whom he paid special honors, so antagonistic
was his son and successor to the same deity.
May it chance that as the mother taught and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
impressed upon the youthful minds of her children
her own religious ideas, so the father especially
in the case of this son, forced them to
acts of worship to the many gods of Egypt which
revolted them and in the end served only to drive
them the further from the old faith. Such is
the perversity of human nature that the very
means taken to win assent to any proposition or
principle are often those which have most influence
in causing the pendulum of thought and
opinion to swing to the opposite extreme.</p>

<p>It is said that the striking change in the physiognomy
and ideal type of the upper classes in
the latter part of the Eighteenth Dynasty points
to strong foreign infusion. The bold, active faces
of earlier times are replaced by sweetness and
delicacy, a gentle smile and small, gracefully
curved nose, this is characteristic of the time of
Amenophis III.</p>

<p>The life of King Amenophis was an active one,
less warlike than most of his predecessors, but
leaving behind many memorials. It is possible
that his long and doubtless exposing hunting expeditions
may have had a bad effect upon him,
for it was still in his prime probably that his life
ended and his wife seems long to have survived
him. His reign, however, covers a lengthy period,
thirty-six years, but he, owing to his father’s
early death, ascended the throne in youth. So,
in the quaint and beautiful language of Scripture,
Amenophis III “slept with his fathers,” and
Amenophis IV reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>The tomb of Amenophis III, discovered by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
French Expedition, is in the West Valley of the
Tombs of the Kings. Here also his father and
many other Egyptian sovereigns were buried. On
the rocky walls are representations of the king
and the gods, some of which were only partially
completed. Amenophis III stands out an attractive
personality among the long list of
Egyptian kings. We cannot doubt that he was
mourned by many, especially by the love of his
youth and later years, Queen Tyi. Henceforth
her life was bound up with that of her eldest son.
She and Amenophis III had, some say two, some
say four sons, and four or five daughters. The
eldest son, who changed his name, was first called
Amenophis IV and his next brother, Tahutmes,
after the grandfather or other ancestor of that
name. The daughters were Isis, Heot-mi-hib
Satamon, of whom some memorials remain, and
some say Beckaten, youngest and favorite, but
who is elsewhere termed grand-daughter, rather
than daughter, of Tyi.</p>

<p>That Queen Tyi was a faithful mother whose
affectionate heart clung to her children as she had
been a loving and devoted wife we cannot doubt.
But her eldest son, the champion of her faith, the
earnest disciple of her teachings, which had sunk
into his heart and borne abundant fruit, must
have been especially beloved. With him her after
history is closely associated, and her influence is
shown even more strongly than during the life of
her husband and there is little question that to
it is largely due the subsequent course of events.
Amenophis III had deferred to her wishes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
shown special marks of favor to her religious
views, but her son accepted them with his whole
heart and spent his life in trying to make them
the religion of his native land.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_12">CHAPTER TWELFTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">TYI (CONTINUED).</span></h2>

<p>As the reign and influence of Queen Hatasu
or Hatshepsut included, in part as those of her
father and two brothers, so did that of Queen
Tyi those of husband and son. The fair young
girl who had left her own country with high
hopes and aspirations had crystallized into the
determined woman, who bent all the energies of
a strong nature to the accomplishment of her
wishes and purposes. The religion of her fore-fathers
was no longer kept in the background.
She inspired her son with the zeal of an apostle
or a fanatic, as we may choose to consider it, and
the king devoted his life to upturning the old
order of things and an endeavor to establish the
new. His father had shown much deference to
his wife’s religious faith. In the new festival, instituted
in his honor, that of the Solar Disk, on
the 16th of Athyr (October 4th), a prominent
place had been assigned in the procession to the
boat of the sun “Aten-ne-fru.” He also put the
disk on the head of his crlo-sphinxes and on the
statues of the goddesses Pasht and Sekhet; but
all this was, in a measure, tentative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>It remained for Amenophis IV, who was by
early writers numbered among the Stranger
kings, till his true paternity was discovered and
now styled himself “Akhenaten” of “Khu-n-aten,”
Worshipper of the (Sun’s Disk) to proclaim openly
his mother’s faith. It has been suggested that
his aim was to provide a god visible to all the
people of his extensive empire, and who could be
worshipped in common by all, or jealousy between
the priests of Heliopolis and those of
Thebes may have been another ingredient in the
mixed and vexed problem. Beside his father’s
great temple at Luxor he erected a sanctuary of
the sun, and in various places the name of Amon
was obliterated.</p>

<p>Whatever the subsequent history of Queen
Tyi’s other children, it was to the eldest son that
the mother evidently clung, and we may perhaps
believe that he, chiefly of them all, shared her
views and opinions. On slips from toilette boxes,
etc., are found the names of the princesses Sat-amen,
Hent-mer-hab and Ast; there was also a
son, with the family name of Tahutmes. Bekaten
is by some believed to be the youngest and favorite
daughter of Tyi, by others to be her grand-daughter,
the child of Amenophis IV, who is
thought to have married before his father’s death.
At Somma is a group of the king and Tyi. At
Qurneh a funeral temple north of Ramesseum, rearranged
by Amenhotep III for his daughter Sit-amen,
which proves that this child, at least, died
before the father. Another inscription read,
“Amen’nekht, princess, prays with her mother, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Amenhotep III, because he praises her beautiful
face and honors her beauty.” Some of the
children probably died young, some may have
married and gone elsewhere, but the eldest, the
father’s successor, had both the will and the
power to plant the new faith, and with him Queen
Tyi’s later life seems closely associated.</p>

<p>As the character of this prince has afforded historians
much ground for speculation, so do the
presentments that remain of him. No cartoon in
Punch could more ludicrously caricature the human
face than do the pictures that are preserved
of King Khu-n-aten. Yet in their ghastly ugliness
they still retain the conventional type. Many
writers seem to consider them as reliable as other
likenesses, and attribute the protruding lips and
attenuated mis-shapen proportions to heredity,
some ancestor of negro blood, or the results of
ill health. Others offer no explanation. It seems
impossible that any reigning king (and in no
period of Egyptian history does the monarch appear
to be more autocratic than at this time)
should have permitted such portraits of himself to
remain to posterity. He was the son of handsome
parents. It is possible that the conventional
type was considered so beautiful that no deviation
which yet preserved the general outline could
mar it? Or perchance is there another solution.
The king forced upon the country a religion abhorrent
to the priests, to the majority of the people,
and to his successors, who soon returned to
the polytheistic faith and worship of earlier centuries,
and who might well have taken pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
in caricaturing and handing down to their
descendants a garbled picture of the hated monarch,
iconoclast as he seemed to them, reformer
as he doubtless appeared in the eyes of his mother
and all the converts to the worship of the sun.
The slanting forehead, the long thin nose, the
protruding, flexible mouth, the serpent-like neck
and the ungainly proportions of the figure are
little calculated to attract admiration.</p>

<p>A parallel to this might perhaps be found in
the case of Richard III of England, who, as he
was a monster of wickedness, must needs be a
monster of ugliness as well, and whose personal
defects have been exaggerated by limner and
scribe until his traditional semblance is that of a
dwarfish fiend.</p>

<p>Says Curtis, “the old Egyptian artist was as
sure of his hand and eye as the French artist
who cut his pupil’s paper with his thumb nail to
indicate that the line should run so and not otherwise.
The coloring is rude and inexpressive, the
drawing of the human figure conventional, for
the church or the priests ordained how the human
form should be drawn. Later the church and
priests ordained how the human form should be
governed. Yet, O sumptuous scarlet queen sitting
on seven hills, you were generous to art,
while you were wronging nature.”</p>

<p>Khu-n-aten or Akhenaten married, however,
and probably in youth, as he was the father of
quite a large family. His wife is spoken of as
the daughter of Dushratta and may have been the
grand-daughter of an Egyptian king, her mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
having married a Syrian prince. Dushratta, writing
to Queen Tyi, before Amenophis IV took up
affairs, greets Tadekhipa, his daughter, Tyi’s
daughter-in-law. As seems to have been the custom,
she changed her name on coming to Egypt
and is known as Aten’neferu,’ Nefertiti, or
Nefertity. She was always closely associated with
the king and there seems no mention of other
wives or connections of any kind. She doubtless
shared or was a convert to his faith and we may
judge its enthusiastic supporter.</p>

<p>Queen Tyi appears to have remained in Thebes
while the king and his wife went to superintend
the building of the temple, palaces, etc., of the
new city which Khu-n-aten had resolved to build
and make his royal residence. Angry blood rose
between him, his priests and his people, but he
was dictator, he would no longer dwell among
them, but in a new and richly adorned city,
worthy of the faith which he held, and whose
building should equal or surpass older monuments.
He issued a command to obliterate from
the tombs of his ancestors the names of the god
Amon and the goddess Mut. This fanned the
smouldering discontent into flames and open rebellion
broke out. Against Amon the king
seemed to hold a particular spite, and around the
shrine of this god priests and followers mustered
their forces.</p>

<p>But although the king abandoned Thebes, he
retained his power and was not overthrown. No
council of priests or people brought him to trial,
sent him into exile, or took his life. Nor in turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
does he seem to have been severe or vengeful.
No records remain, as is frequently the case in
such instances, of barbarous punishments or cruel
executions being meted out to the offenders. For
the time being, if for that only, he was absolute
and carried his point. He could afford to be
generous.</p>

<p>The new capital was distant from both Memphis
and Thebes, in middle Egypt, and received
the name of Khu-a-ten, or as it is elsewhere
given, Khuteteyn, “the horizon of the sun,” the
modern Tel-el-Amarna or El-Amarna, the extensive
ruins of which may yet be seen on both banks
of the Nile. Like Solomon in Scripture, the
potentate summoned to his assistance both artists
and artizans, and the work was pressed with all
possible vigor and speed. First the temple, then
the palaces and homes of the nobility, lastly, in
the neighborhood, their tombs. It is said that a
revolution in art proceeded side by side with that
in religion, an attempt was made to discard the
older traditions and approximate more nearly to
nature, and the specimen of these attempts at realism,
to be found in the tombs, are of great interest.
To this fact some authorities attribute the
singular and disagreeable portraits of the king before
referred to.</p>

<p>How deeply Queen Tyi’s heart was stirred and
how keenly her feelings were concerned we may
well conceive. The great enterprise was the development
of her heart’s desire and every aid in
her power she must have lent to the king’s assistance.
Remaining in the old city she could no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
doubt expedite the sending of all sorts of supplies
and materials required for the buildings and
the private needs of her beloved son and his
family.</p>

<p>Architecture and sculpture were ever important
in the eyes of the Egyptian kings, and even the
queens had their own sculptors and overseers of
such work. Timber was scarce, quarries of sandstone
and limestone numerous, hence the more
enduring was the commoner material, which has
preserved to posterity much that, had the ancient
world been constructed of our more perishable
wood and brick, in all probability would have utterly
passed away. Some of the temples, as many
of the tombs, of which those at Beni Hassan are
an example, were in grottoes and caves, others
stood alone in majestic grandeur; in all columns
were used and the lotus was the prevailing ornament.
Says Kendric, “As the columns of Beni
Hassan gave rise to the Doric, so those which
imitate plants and flowers appear to be the origin
of the Corinthian. The Ionian volute is found in
the columns of Persepolis, but in no Egyptian
monument. It was probably of Assyrian origin,
as it has been found in the remains of Nineveh.”</p>

<p>An inscription at Telel-Amarna reads, “And
for the first time the king gave the command to
call together all the masons from the Island of
Elephantine to the town of Samud (special name
for Migdol in Lower Egypt) and the chiefs and
the leaders of the people to open a great quarry
of the hard stone for the erection of the great
obelisk of Har-makhu, by his name, as the god<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of light, who is (worshipped) as the sun’s disk in
Thebes. Thither came the great and noble lords
and the chief of the fan-bearers, to superintend
the cutting and shipping of the stone.” Brugsch
tells us that the stone quarry of Assoan and the
cliffs of Silsilis on each side of the river furnished,
the former rose and black granite, and the latter
hard brown sandstone for this work. He also
thinks that King Khu-n-aten designed to build in
Thebes a gigantic pyramid of this same stone to
the honor of his god.</p>

<p>Not far from the Nile, in the new city, rose the
great temple of the sun. It was on a wide plain,
the mountains rising behind it as says the same
author, “like an encompassing wall.” The king
also bestowed great honor upon his chief overseers
and helpers, who accepted the new faith
and entered into the work with real or assumed
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>One named Meri-ra or Mery-Re “dear to the
sun” was high-priest or prophet, the Pharaoh bestowing
upon him words of praise and commendation
and investing him with that special kingly
reward, a golden necklace. His tomb at Tel el
Amarna is one of the most interesting and largest
that have been found. It is supported by columns
and on its walls are depicted many scenes giving
portraits of the deceased and his wife, the king
and queen making offerings to the sun, the princesses
and others. And it is here that is found the
picture of the bestowal of the golden necklace.</p>

<p>A certain Aahmes, one of the many, for this
seems long to have been a favorite name in Egypt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
was another highly valued assistant and among
the sepulchral inscriptions found at Tel-el-Amarna
was a prayer to the son written by him.
Beginning with ascription, it reads, “Beautiful is
thy setting thou son’s disk of life, thou lord of
lords and king of worlds,” and ending with professions
of devotion to the king, as his “divine
benefactor,” who had raised him to greatness,
which naturally perhaps appears to have produced
a very pleasing state of mind, for he concludes
“the servant of the prince rejoices and is in a
festive disposition every day.”</p>

<p>At this time there were at least several grandchildren
of Queen Tyi, as special houses were prepared
for them in connection with the palace.
We can therefore imagine the impatience with
which the dowager queen awaited the time for
her journey to the new city and rejoining her
loved ones, and couriers were doubtless busy,
passing back and forth, with orders and directions
from the king, as well as messages of affection
to his mother, which were returned in full measure.
It seems almost as if it might be at his
special desire that she remained in Thebes, to lend
him, as before said, all the aid in her power
towards the completion of his work and that he
might have the satisfaction of welcoming her to
his new capital in a nearly completed state. She
may also have acted to some extent as regent in
his absence.</p>

<p>Her time of anticipation therefore must have
endured for some years, since the erection of
buildings of such magnitude could not have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
accomplished in a very short period, no matter
what the expedition used for the purpose. This
second journey may well have reminded Queen
Tyi of an earlier one she had taken in her youth,
from her far native land, as the wife or the affianced
bride of Amenophis III. That had been
the seed-time, the sowing of which had produced
such great fruits. Again she went forward attended
by a large retinue, but now it was not to
a land of promise, but one of fulfilment.</p>

<p>The king and his wife met the dowager queen
after their long separation with all honor and affection,
and themselves conducted her into the
new temple. A picture of this scene, which remains,
is thus inscribed, “Introduction of the
queen mother to behold her sun shadow,” and very
happy she must have felt in thus viewing the
visible tokens of the realization of the dreams,
hopes and prayers of many years. She must inspect
the temple, the palaces of the king, queen
and the various princesses, as well as the dwelling
prepared for herself, and no doubt be made acquainted
with the chief overseers and artists whom
“the king delighted to honor,” and under whose
charge the work had so prospered. The private
houses were probably varied in color and frequently
decorated on the outside with pictures of
the occupations or professions of the owners. Beyond,
some such scene as this, an immense
meadow cut through with a blue stream, north
and south, white walls of towns, on the horizons
rim the reddish sands of the desert. The myth
they believed in was this, “Osiris fell in love with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
this strip of land in the midst of deserts. He
covered it with plants and living creatures, so as
to have from them profit. Then the kindly god
took a human form and became the first pharaoh.
When he felt that his body was withering he left
it and entered into his son and later into his
son’s son. The lord has extended like a mighty
tree. All the pharaohs are his roots, the nomarks
and priests his larger branches, the nobles the
smaller branches. The visible god sits on the
throne of the earth and receives the income which
belongs to him from Egypt; the invisible god receives
offerings in his temples and declares his
will through the lips of the priesthood.”</p>

<p>It was a joyful reunion, this of the elder queen
with her son and his family, an occasion never to
be forgotten in their domestic annals, and we may
imagine how the story was handed down from
generation to generation. The day when grandmother,
or great-grandmother came and saw the
new temple and new city. Loved and honored
Queen Tyi probably settled down with or near
her son and his wife, enjoying to the full the
kindly family life and seeing as had her mother-in-law
before her the grandchildren gather
around. Perhaps she regretted that no son was
born to succeed his father, for King Khu-n-aten
had daughters only, but her life had been a full
and happy one and she had enjoyed the blessing,
accorded to but few, of seeing her heart’s dearest
wishes fulfilled. What more could she ask?</p>

<p>Whether she passed away in Khu-aten, or Tel-el-Amarna,
we do not know, but if the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
was the case a long mourning procession, attended
with every honor, must have borne her inanimate
form preserved in the highest style of the
embalmer’s art, back to Thebes, for there in the
Tombs of the Queens her last resting place has
been found. These tombs are at the end of a
valley, which extends for nearly a mile to the
west of the temple of Medinet Habu, that of Tyi
is said to be among the most perfect. The valley
which leads to the tombs has bare and lofty limestone
cliffs on either side, which are covered with
inscriptions; it is not so familiar as some other
places in Egypt, not being very easy of access.
More than twenty tombs in various stages of
completion have been discovered, some of them
mere caves with their records often made not in
the solid stone, but in plaster. Queen Tyi’s tomb
consists of an ante-chamber, passages, a chapel,
and small chambers, all more or less decorated
with paintings. At the entrance, on either side,
is Maat, the goddess of Truth, with extended
wings, to protect those who come in. There are
various pictures of the gods and of Queen Tyi, in
one of which she prays to them, seated at a banquet
table.</p>

<p>Of these tombs Curtis says, “The sculpture and
paintings are gracious and simple. They are not
graceful, but suggest the grace and repose which
the ideal of female life requires. In the graceful
largeness and simplicity of the character of the
decoration it seems as if the secret or reverence
for womanly character and influence, which was
to be later revealed was instinctively suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
by those who knew them not. The cheerful yellow
hues of the walls and their exposure to the
day, the warm silence of the hills, seclusion, and
the rich luminous landscape in the vista of the
steep valley, make these tombs pleasant pavilions
of memory.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_13">CHAPTER THIRTEENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">NEFERTITI.</span></h2>

<p>Before the death of Amenophis III he seems
to have adopted the frequent Egyptian habit of
associating his son with him on the throne, though
the latter was probably young, as Queen Tyi appears
to have acted as regent after her husband’s
death. Also, at the time of his death, the father
was negotiating for a marriage between his heir
and a Mitannian princess, the same country from
which had come Queen Tyi herself, and the wife
of Thothmes IV. That the existing relationship
gave the new queen some title to the throne is
proved by her being spoken of as “the great heiress,
princess of all women,” and “the princess of
South and North, the lady of both lands,” which
imply hereditary rights, possibly through the
mother.</p>

<p>She was the daughter of Dushratta, King of
Mitanni, and it may have been that her father
was Queen Tyi’s brother and she herself the
cousin of Amenophis IV, but the matter is not
absolutely clear. A certain Dushratta, not satisfied
about the safety of his sister, who had married
Amenophis III, had sent to Egypt to inquire
after her, but the repetition or duplication of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
name often makes it difficult to decide upon the
exact relationship. From the letters found on tablets
in the ruins of Tel-el-Amarna, many of which
of course are broken and imperfect, we have
chiefly derived the information we possess of these
transactions. Queen Tyi seems also to have held
the power for a brief period at Tel-el-Amarna,
but exactly when this was the case has not been
discovered.</p>

<p>In her own country the bride-elect bore the
name of Tadukipa, but in Egypt she became
Nefert-Thi, Nefertity, or Nefertiti, her full name
being known as Aten’nefer’ neferu’nefertiti. After
the death of Amenophis III Queen Tyi sent word
of this event to the Babylonish prince, and some
correspondence took place between them before
matters were finally settled and Amenophis IV or
Napkhurruiya, as he is called in the letters, was
married and assumed full control of his own affairs.
There was, of course, an exchange of presents,
gold, slaves, etc., as was usual on such occasions,
and no failure on either side of a satisfactory
pecuniary showing seems to have interfered
with the prospects of the youthful pair, such
as had been known, not unfrequently, in other
cases.</p>

<p>The beautiful, deserving or undeserving, are
apt to win favor. By this rule therefore the pictures
of King Khu-n-aten or Aten’ nefer’neferu
and Queen Nefertiti are sufficiently ugly to prejudice
the most casual observer. One is tempted
to see in these hideous effigies rather the work
of a defamer than a true portrait. Early pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of the king are handsome and not unlike some of
Rameses II, the change is attributed by late
writers to the new style of art to be seen in his
reign. Certainly the king sacrificed himself nobly
to the cause of Truth, if he was a consenting
party to his own portraiture.</p>

<p>It is believed that the accession of Khu-n-aten
took place in the thirty-first year of his father’s
reign, in the month Pakhons, or February, and
that his marriage occurred in the month Epiphi,
or May, four years later. In his sixth year he
abandoned the god Amon, or Amen, and adopted
the Aten worship. In his sixth year also, after
the birth of his second daughter, came the change
of name and facial type at Thebes, Maat only of
the old divinities seems to have been retained.
The pictures of this period show rays of sunbeams
terminating in tiny hands which support the
bodies, crowns, etc., of the royal pair.</p>

<p>From first to last the queen is closely associated
with her husband, constantly pictured with him, a
true companion and helpmate, a faithful guardian
of his children, and a devoted daughter to his
mother, possibly her aunt, whose name, in part,
she seems to have taken. As Kidijah upheld and
supported Mahomet in the promulgation of his
newly received revelation, so did Nefertiti accept
and lend her wifely aid to the faith of her husband
and his mother.</p>

<p>A prayer or address to the rising sun is attributed
to her and shows the religious fervor
with which she was penetrated.</p>

<p>“Thou disk of the sun, thou living god! there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
is none other beside thee! Thou givest health
to the eyes through thy beams, creator of all beings.
Thou goest up on the eastern horizon of
the heavens to dispense life to all whom thou hast
created; to man, to four-footed beasts, birds and
all manner of creeping things on the earth, when
they live. Thus they behold thee and they go to
sleep when thou settest.</p>

<p>“Grant to thy son who loves thee life in truth
to the Lord of the land that he may live united
with thee in eternity.</p>

<p>“Behold his wife the queen Nefert-i-Thi, may
she live forevermore and eternally by his side,
well pleasing to thee she admires what thou
hast created day by day. He (the king) rejoices
at the sight of thy benefits. Grant him a long
existence as king of the land.”</p>

<p>At Heliopolis the sun-god Ra had been specially
worshipped. He was pictured hawk-headed, surmounted
by disk and uraeus, hence with priests
at Heliopolis the king may have been in greater
sympathy than with those at other points, where
the various gods were worshipped. It is possible,
too, that they were less antagonistic to him than
the others, or may even have supported him. Be
that as it may, at Heliopolis Khu-n-aten built a
temple. The shrine received gifts from Pharaoh
after Pharaoh and was very wealthy. It also had
at one time an immense library. “The city,” says
Strabo, who came to it shortly after the Christian
Era, “is situated upon a large mound. It contains
the Temple of the Sun,” probably a later one than
that of Amenophis IV, “and the Ox Mnevis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
which is kept in a sanctuary, and is regarded by
the inhabitants as a god.” Says Pollard, “The
temple had three courts, each one probably
adorned with obelisks, which were so numerous
that one was called ‘The City of Obelisks.’
Pharaohs of different dynasties erected a pair of
obelisks in the temple of the Sun as an offering
and a memorial. After the third court came the
Naos, with its outer chamber or holy place and its
inner or holy of holies, in which was the shrine
with the symbol of the deity. Strabo tells us that
the ox Mnevis was kept in the sanctuary.”</p>

<p>Six daughters, one after another, enlarged the
family circle of the palace “a garland of princesses,”
as they have been poetically called. They
constantly appear in the pictures with their
parents and even attended their father in his expeditions
in his chariot. Their names are given
as Mi-aten or Mut-aten, Mak-aten, Anknes-aten,
Nofru-aten, or Nofrura, Ta-shera, Satem-en-ra
and Bek-aten, some doubt seems to exist as to
whether the last was daughter or grand-daughter
of Queen Tyi. A standing figure of this princess,
at which the artists are still seen chiselling from
life, under the eye of the queen’s overseer, Putha,
by name, is among the various wall paintings.
Perhaps she was an especial darling, this youngest
child, or she may have had a particularly beautiful
face and form; but the temple walls were
said to have been nearly covered with the pictures
of the king, queen and princess. Aten-en-aten
or Khu-n-aten’s feelings towards his family were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
tinged with all a lover’s enthusiasm. His words
have a poetic cast.</p>

<p>“The beams of the sun’s disk shone over him
with a pure light so as to make young his body
daily.</p>

<p>“Therefore King Khu-n-aten swore an oath to
his father thus: Sweet love fills my heart for the
queen, for her young children. Grant a great
age to the queen Nofrit-Thi in long years; may
she keep the hand of Pharaoh. Grant a great
age to the royal daughter Meri-aten and to the
royal daughter Mak-aten and to their children,
may they keep the hand of the queen their mother
eternally and forever.</p>

<p>“What I swear is a true avowal of what my
heart says to me. Never is there falsehood in
what I say,” and he ends a long inscription, relative
to the setting up of various memorial tablets
with, “These memorial tablets which were placed
in the midst had fallen down. I will have them
raised up afresh and have them placed again in
the situation in which they were (previously).
This I swear to do in the 8th year, in the month
Tybi, on the 9th day the king was in Khuaten and
Pharaoh mounted on his court chariot of polished
copper to behold the memorial tablets of the disk
of the sun which are on the hills of the territory
to the south-east of Khu-aten.” And perhaps the
queen and the eldest daughters followed him to
make this investigation. Brugsch says the inscriptions
on these tablets were first found and
published by Prisse d’Avennes.</p>

<p>The series of tablets discovered at Tel-el-Amarna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
in 1888 are chiefly in the museums of
London, Berlin, Paris and St. Petersburgh, with
a few at Gizeh. One letter is from a lady who
styles herself “the handmaid” of the king and
others relate to the exchange of presents and
slaves, men and girls.</p>

<p>Another beloved member of this amiable family
was the princess Notem-Mut, younger sister of
the queen, who seems quite to have been counted
in. She, too, had a special palace built for her,
and married Horem-heb or Ho-rem-hib, not of
royal birth, but who eventually became the last
king of this, the Eighteenth Dynasty. He may
have had two wives, or else Notem-mut changed
her name, as we read also of a queen Ese as his
spouse.</p>

<p>The temples and palaces were of a somewhat
different style of architecture from the usual
Egyptian form, but they were beautiful, with
their open courts, and calculated for the needs of
those who were to occupy them, as well as for
the character of the country and climate. The
names of the artists and architects are preserved,
which is not usually the case, and their talent
seems to have descended in the family, for we
learn that a certain Bek, overseer, artist and
teacher of the king, was a grandson of Hor-amoo,
who had served in the same office under Amenophis
III.</p>

<p>“The tombstone of the artist, Bek,” says
Brugsch, “was put up for sale some years ago
in the open market place in Cairo. My respected
friend, Mr. L. Vassali, bought it, and was good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
enough to give me an exact drawing of the carving
upon it and a paper impression of the inscription.”</p>

<p>The wall pictures that were found in the tombs
present the king and queen seated on a balcony
with their eldest children, the baby in the mother’s
lap, enduring certain officials with the necklace
of honor and casting down presents to the crowd.
A pleasant sport, enjoyed in common by the whole
family party. Queen Tyi, the chief of the
women’s department, named Hai, the steward, the
treasurer and other members of the court, also
shared in the fun.</p>

<p>Another picture gives the king and queen worshipping
the sun, accompanied by two of their
daughters, showing clearly that all the duties and
pleasures of life were shared in this amiable family.
A touch of Nature makes us all kin, and
this recalls the picture one often sees of domestic
life among the Germans, where father, mother
and children go off for a picnic or a frolic together,
while the Frenchman perhaps is in the
café alone.</p>

<p>The Egyptians were highly skilled in pottery
and faience; fine glazing on pottery, stone and
in enamels on goldsmith work is shown at the
beginning of the New Empire. Tel-el-Amarna
seems to have been quite celebrated for its pottery
and the fabrication of delicate enamels, of which
many specimens, in a great variety of colors, have
been found. The vase of Queen Tyi, preserved
in the Boulak Museum, is grey and blue. Olive-shaped
amulets of the kings and princesses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
this family show delicate blue hieroglyphics on a
mauve ground, while the potters of the time of
Amenophis III are said to have been particularly
fond of violets and greys.</p>

<p>Less warlike than the majority of his predecessors,
we still read of some fighting during Aten-aten’s
or Khu-n-aten’s reign and victories over
the Syrians and other nations, which the king,
though probably not taking the field himself, celebrated
with the customary festival. He appears
in “the full Pharaonic attire, adorned with the
insignia of his rank, on his lion throne, carried
on the shoulders of his warriors. At his side walk
servants, who, with long fans, wave the cool air
upon their heated lord.” This was in the twelfth
year of his reign, on the 18th day of the month
Mekhir, December. The crook, whip, and sickle-shaped
sword were emblems of royalty, while of
the New Empire was a canopy raised on wooden
pillars, colored and ornamented, with a thick carpet
on seat, footstool and floor. On ordinary occasions
the king was probably carried in a sort
of Sedan chair of splendid appearance.</p>

<p>Later occurred the marriages of some of the
daughters, and as no son was born, two at least
of the sons-in-law seem to have ruled in succession,
and it is pleasant to be able to believe that
this was peacefully accomplished, without the
family jars and broils so often coincident with
the dividing of a heritage. In modern parlance
the ladies do not seem to have made very brilliant
matches. No foreign prince or monarch is recorded
as being an accepted suitor. “Home talent”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
was strictly patronized, and the sons of high officials
were deemed suitable parties, who by right
of their wives it would seem, succeeded each
other as king. Their reigns were short enough
for each to have a turn as the pleasant task of
ruling.</p>

<p>Several of his daughters, as well as his wife,
waited on Khu-n-aten in his last illness; Nefertiti
survived him and may have lived till the time of
Horem-heb, or even to that of Sety I. The tomb
of the king was seven miles from the river in
one of the great valleys which open on the plain
of Tel-el-Amarna, the situation resembling that
of Amenophis III at Thebes. That he was
mourned deeply, at least by those nearest and
dearest to him, there can be little doubt, yet his
children soon turned from the religion he had
tried to establish, to the earlier worship, in its
form of devotion to many gods, under the semblance
of various animals. The slabs found at
Memphis, the stele at Sakkarah, and the remains
of the great temple at Tel-el-Amarna, twenty-five
feet square, the enclosure nearly half a mile long,
all speak of this king.</p>

<p>Statues of him, his wife and Queen Tyi have
been found, a beautiful and perfect one of the
king is in the Louvre, and there is a death mask,
which, among his various names, speaks of him
as the “lord of the sweet wind.” Fragments of
the stele with which his palace was decorated are
to be seen in some of the museums in Europe,
also in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and perhaps at other points in this
country.</p>

<p>It seems to have been the sons-in-law who
took chief authority, after Khu-n-aten’s death, and
not the queen. She survived her husband for
years. Her palace had a court, or harim, with
glazed tiles, the walls painted with scenes, and
the floor with pools, birds, cattle and wild plants.
In the court was a fine well with a canopy on
carved columns, and round coping, and an inscription
with the queen’s titles. In the temple
offerings of flowers were made and hymns sung
to the accompaniment of harps, it was perhaps
a return to the practice of the earliest times, and
one writer suggests that its simplicity points to
the Vedism of India. The queen and her daughters
are shown waiting on the king in his illness.
There is a fine fragment of a statue of the queen
at Amherst college, and a gold ring and some
other personal belongings at other places. With
the death mask of the king in the University of
Pennsylvania are some fragments from Tel-el-Amarna
giving the names and title of Queen
Nefertiti. Khu-n-aten is thought by late discoveries
to have reigned seventeen or eighteen years.</p>

<p>As usual authorities differ, some giving Ai as
the immediate successor of Khu-n-aten, others
placing before him several kings, and numbering
him just before Horem-heb, Horem-hib or Horus,
the last monarch of the Eighteenth Dynasty.
Some again refuse to recognize the heretic king
and his descendants at all, and consider Horem-hib,
who had returned to the polytheistic creed, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the true and direct successor of Amenophis III.
It seems likely, however, that the eldest daughter,
Mut-aten, born in the fourth year of her father’s
reign was married just before his death to
Re’smenkh’ka and that her husband was, for a
time, co-regent. Both his and her name have
been found on a tomb, these tomb inscriptions always
throwing great light on this history of the
time to which they refer. If, as estimated, she
was thirteen at the time of her marriage and
twenty-five at her husband’s death, he reigned
over twelve years.</p>

<p>The second daughter, Mak-aten, died before
her father, between her ninth and eleventh years;
her tomb is in a side chapel of her father’s and
the family are shown mourning for her, but she
appears in the picture of the six princesses.
Anknes-aten or Ankh s’en’pa’aten was born in the
eighth year of her father’s reign and was ten
years of age at his death. In her sister’s reign
she was married to Tut-ankh’aten and changed
her name to Ankh’s’en’amen, “her life is from
Amen,” showing that already the changes her
father had made were discarded. A few rings
belonging to her remain, but with the exception
of these relics nothing more is known of the
other daughters, also nothing is known beyond
figures and names on general monuments. Of
Ras’ Ra’smenka or Ra’smenkh’ka’ser’kheperu,
husband of the eldest daughter of Queen Nefertiti
it is believed that he abandoned the palace in
his third year of sovereignty and perhaps went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Thebes; there are few remains of him, but the
dates are estimated as 1368-1358 B. C.</p>

<p>Tut’ankh-Amon or Twet-Ankh-Amon, “the living
image of Aman” and husband of Anknes-amon,
transferred his residence to Thebes (which,
after all, had suffered little from the rivalry of
Tel-el-Amarna), hastily finished the great hall
and had it decorated with reliefs, representing the
great festival which occurred at Luxor on New
Year’s Day, when the sacred boats were brought
up in procession, on the Nile, from Karnak, and
carried into the temple. In these reliefs, of
course, the king’s name largely figured, but, in
the not uncommon fashion of these various monarchs,
his brother-in-law, who later succeeded him,
King Horem-heb, freely substituted his own
name. A picture of King Tut’ankh Amon holding
court and receiving a negro queen, either as a
visitor or as offering tribute, was found on the
wall of a tomb. The royal lady was depicted in
a chariot, drawn by oxen and surrounded by her
servants, a prototype of a later visit of the Queen
of Sheba to King Solomon. From the north
also came the ruddy princes of the land of
Ruthen, with curly black hair and in rich dresses.
The two governors of the South and North, Hi
and Amenhotep, also came; they had served under
Amenophis III and must have been of ripe
years. Brugsch calls it “a large and lively picture
of the manners and riches of the South and
of the North in the fifteenth century, before
Christ.” All bring rich gifts and ask for peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and friendship between themselves and the great
Pharaoh.</p>

<p>King Ai was probably husband of one of the
daughters, though his wife is elsewhere spoken
of as the foster-mother of King Khu-n-aten,
which seems rather hopelessly to mix up the
chronology. In this case she is spoken of as Thi, the
beloved name of that king’s own mother. They
are also called respectively “the dressers of the
king,” and “the high nurse, the nourishing mother
of the godlike one.” Ai’s fine tomb at Tel-el-Amarna
gives an account of his marriage. The
tomb was never entirely finished; it is described
by one traveller as having a sepulchral hall, beautifully
painted, with colors still fresh and brilliant,
with the sarcophagus standing in the middle,
among the pictures, the king painted red and
the queen of a pale yellow, are shown gathering
lotus flowers; also the king being presented by
the goddesses Mat and Hathor to Osiris. Perhaps
two wives shared the honor of sovereignty
with King Ai, or the second may have been
espoused after the death of the first, and it seems
likely the latter was much her husband’s junior.</p>

<p>Maspero gives a description of the palace of
King Ai, also pictured on the walls of the Tel-el-Amarna
tombs. He calls him the son-in-law
of Khu-en-aten. “An oblong tank with sloping
sides and two descending flights of steps, faces
the entrance. The building is rectangular, the
width being somewhat greater than the depth. A
large doorway opens in the front, and gives access
to a court planted with trees, and flanked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
by storehouses, fully stocked with provisions.
Two small courts, placed symmetrically in the
two further corners, contain the staircases, which
lead up to the terrace. This first building, however,
is but the frame which surrounds the owner’s
dwelling. The two frontages are much
adorned with a pillared portico and a pylon. Passing
the outer door, one enters a sort of central
passage, divided by two walls, pierced with doorways,
so as to form three successive courts. The
inside court is bordered by chambers, the two
others open to right and left upon two smaller
courts, whence flights of steps lead up to the
terraced roof. This central building is called the
‘Akhonuti,’ or private dwelling of kings and
nobles, to which only the family or intimate
friends had access.”</p>

<p>All this, of course, varied in different cases
with the taste of the owner, and the long, straight
wall in front was sometimes divided and ornamented
with colonnades and towers.</p>

<p>The old religion was resuming its sway, and
the priests of Amon regaining their lost influence.
They accepted the rule of Tut’ankh-Amon, whose
monuments are said to extend only from Memphis
to Thebes, and still more that of Ay, who was a
true worshipper of the old gods. His reign, however,
is spoken of as “feeble,” and the principal
monument of the time is a shrine, high up in
the face of cliffs, behind Ekhmin. King Ay
seemed to have a special passion for tomb building,
as there are no less than three attributed to
him. The first at Tel-el-Amarna, the last at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Thebes, coincident probably with his complete
change of religious views and associations.</p>

<p>Ay died and left no children, and was succeeded
by Horem-heb, or Horem-hib, who then
was, or subsequently became, his uncle by a marriage
with the Princess Notem-Mut, or Nezem-Mut,
sister of Queen Nefertiti. The history of
this time is, as yet, far from clear, and dates which
fit in approximately to one set of theories, refuse
to combine with others; some hold that Queen
Nefertiti had been originally sent to Egypt to be
the bride of Amenophis III, and that his death
occurring before her arrival, she then became the
wife of his son. This last arrangement, judging
by the probable years of the parties, was
more natural, and the union seemed to have
proved a most happy one, as all the pictures show
complete concord of interest and sentiment between
the two. Defaced pictures of both Queen
Tyi and Queen Nefertiti are found in the tombs,
and the mummy of King Khu-n-aten was found
in the tomb of Amenophis II, where it had, probably
been removed to avoid spoliation, his tomb
having been originally elsewhere.</p>

<p>King Horem-heb seems first to have been a
renowned general in the army, and though not
of royal birth, his horoscope foretold for him
great success. The earlier histories of him say
that he was a special favorite of King Khu-n-aten,
who made him guardian of the kingdom,
which position, so near the throne, suggests opportunities
to win the heart of the princess. The
god Amon, it is said, brought her to him, “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
crown prince Horem-hib,” and the inscription
adds, “she bowed herself and embraced his pleasant
form, and placed herself before him.” Was
it perchance on account of this kind service of
the god that they both espoused his religion so
fervently, or did the priests tamper with the princess
and she inspire her lover with enthusiasm
for the old beliefs?</p>

<p>This romantic history, however, loses somewhat
of its glamour under the realistic touches and
conclusions of later students. The princess was
a priestess of Amon, and the marriage of the
two, it is claimed, was merely a political one,
both king and queen being between fifty and
sixty at the time of their union. The kind offices
of the god may be, so to speak, mythologically
considered. The long account which gives an exultant
story of his coronation, prejudges the fact
that both the king and queen were zealous supporters
of the ancient religion, and again Thebes
became the royal city. The work of Khu-n-aten
there was destroyed and a new temple built. At
Karnak, as was frequently the wont of the kings,
Horem-hib built with materials taken from a
ruined temple of Amenophis II. He also built
a rock temple at Silsilis, where inscriptions certify
to his victories.</p>

<p>The pictures of this king and his mother Sonit,
at a banquet, where some of the company were
of the living, some of the dead, has been described
in an earlier chapter, as also the statues
of himself and his wife, he with a handsome,
melancholy face, she also handsome, but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
a touch of sarcasm in her smile. Her likeness
has been ascribed to other queens.</p>

<p>The group of Horem-hib and the god Amon,
in the Turin Museum, is pronounced to be “dry
in treatment,” while the colossi in red granite,
against his pylon at Karnak, the bas-reliefs at Silsilis,
and the portrait statue just referred to are
deemed by the same critic “faultless.” Other
wall decorations show the king conferring the insignia
of the Golden Collar upon a certain Nefer-hotep
of Thebes. He is sometimes improperly
called Horus, while Manetho by this name refers
to Khu-n-aten.</p>

<p>Of Queen Nezem-mut there are not many remains,
and these may be briefly enumerated. She
figures in the tomb of Ay in a family group;
there is the statue of her with the King at Turin;
she appears as a female sphinx as given by Rosellini,
there is a scarab at Berlin, and a frog with
her name at Abydos. Since, with the reign of
Horem-hib the eighteenth dynasty concludes,
and so little is to be found as regards his wife,
we have included her brief history with that of
her sister, Queen Nefertiti, in the present chapter.
A new dynasty, the nineteenth, succeeded, while
some authorities maintain that the early members
of the Ramesside family were contemporary with
Horem-hib.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_14">CHAPTER FOURTEENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">TUAA.</span></h2>

<p>Probably years after Queen Tyi, or Tuaa, wife
of Amenophis III and mother of the heretic King
Khu-n-aten, was laid in her grave, her grand-daughter
and namesake became the consort of
the reigning monarch. The Eighteenth Dynasty
had passed away and a new race held sway. They
seem to have had no hereditary title to the crown,
but may have claimed Hyksos ancestry. Might,
however, often makes right, and they were a
noted and powerful succession of monarchs. After
King Horem-hib and Queen Notem-Mut came
in Rameses I, of the Nineteenth Dynasty, of
whose wife we at present know nothing, though
future discoveries may reveal her identity. After
a short reign the king was succeeded by his son
Seti, or Sety I, called Merenptah or Mereptah,
“Son of Ptah,” who strengthened his position by
marrying a descendant of the preceding royal
line. She brought him as her dower, in addition
to whatever else she might have been mistress of,
the valuable possession of the true “blue blood,”
which she conferred upon her son, Rameses II,
“born of Ra,” and thus made his claim to the
crown indisputable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Queen Ti, Thy, Tyi, Tui, or Tuaa, as her name
is variously spelled, did not have so romantic a
love story as did her great ancestress, but neither
would it be quite fair to set down her marriage
with Set I as purely one of convenience, no matter
how much each might have gained by the
union. Their opportunities of meeting, since
Egyptian women are not so cloistered as other
Eastern nations, may have been frequent, and it
is possible the connection may have been one
of feeling, as well as of state policy. Of her
early life, however, we know nothing, nor are
we assured of the name of her parents. In marrying
her Seti I conformed to the usual but not
invariable custom of these monarchs, in uniting
themselves with a princess of Egyptian lineage.</p>

<p>The priests acknowledged the new queen as
of the blood royal, the true Theban line, hence
there could be no dispute as to the rights of her
children. Her experiences were different from
those of her great predecessor of the name; she
did not journey from a far country to meet her
husband, in all probability, as did her great-grandmother,
nor did she share with him as did her
grandmother, in the effort to promulgate a new
religion, constantly pictured beside him in all his
occupations. She was both the wife and mother
of a warrior, and life must of necessity have
passed much a part from them.</p>

<p>To us Queen Tuaa is but a shadowy form,
chiefly known as the mother of perhaps the greatest
king in the long Egyptian line. Some of
her traits of character, some of her features, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
have descended to this haughty scion of the race,
but they are now beyond our power of specification.
He did not show her, apparently, the devotion
the first Tyi received from her son, and
in his attention to his father’s tomb there is no
record of any special care of his mother’s, though
doubtless it was not neglected. “On the walls
of one of the temples,” says one traveler, “the
youthful Rameses is being suckled by the goddesses;
on the one side by Anek (or Anouka) ‘his
divine mother, Lady of Elephantine’; on the
other by Hathor, with a similar inscription, the
features are so much alike that they probably
represent those of his own mother.” As a child
even Rameses must have been freed, in great
measure, from his mother’s guidance, since, to
establish himself more firmly on the throne, Seti
made his son co-ruler with himself, and, to some
extent, a sharer in the cares of state and knowledge
of warfare.</p>

<p>It is said that Queen Tuaa acted as regent for
husband or son during a Syrian campaign. She
must have been proud of her talented and precious
child, but state etiquette doubtless separated
her much from him, and there may have
been more outlet for motherly care and tenderness
among her other children; of these we do not
find much record, save one brother, to whom
Rameses was greatly attached. This brother was
called Khamus. Tuaa is not recorded as having
shared her queenly honors or her husband’s affection
with other wives, at any rate, she was the
legal consort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Duff Gordon speaks of Egypt as “the
palimpsest in which the Bible is written over Herodotus,
and the Koran over that.” At this period
it was in the middle stage of this classification.
The modern Copt most resembles the ancient
Egyptian; the nose and eyes are the same as
in the profiles in the tombs and temples. The
fellah woman of the present, it is said, walks
around the ancient statues in order to have children,
and the customs at birth and burial are the
same as in ancient times. Of marriage customs
of the past less is known, as we have to bear in
mind, than of their funeral ceremonies. The
genuine Egyptian had a bronze colored skin, recognizing
a brother countryman at a glance and
despising black, yellow and even white skins; the
queen herself, being of ancient race, may have
indulged this feeling; certainly it was most apparent
in her haughty son.</p>

<p>Was Queen Tuaa beautiful, good looks being
usually thought an important part of the claims
of a royal bride to her position, a picture, often
flattered, being the only means a royal suitor had
to judge of his future wife? Curtis thus describes
a beautiful Egyptian: “The Greek Venus
was sea born, but our Egyptian is sun born. The
brown blood of the sun burns along her veins—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
soul of the sun streams shaded from her
eyes.” Fascinating are the almond-eyes of Egyptian
women, bordered black with the kohl, whose
intensity accords with the sumptuous passion that
mingles moist and languid with their light; Eastern
eyes are full of moonlight. Eastern beauty
is a dream of passionate possibility. Was the
queen perchance of this temperament: “I am of a
silent disposition. I never tell what I see. I spoil
not the sweetness of my fruits by vain tattling.”
For posterity, at least, she has proved so, for we
know little of her.</p>

<p>The chief, if not the only picture of Queen
Tuaa, is in the temple of Goornah or El Kurn-neh,
which is described as a memorial edifice, like
the Medici Chapel in Florence. Begun by Seti
I, as a memorial to Rameses I, it was completed
by Rameses II. They were handsome men of a
Dantesque type, and their mothers and wives
probably fair women, the men, especially, different
in appearance from the preceding race.
Rameses I was the tutelary deity of the shrine.
He stands swathed and crowned like Osiris, with
the pointed and upturned beard peculiar to the
gods, worshipped, in one picture, by his own son,
Seti I, and in another by his grandson, Rameses
II.</p>

<p>“In Egypt every man,” especially if he were
of royal birth, “received, after death, by courtesy,
the title of Osiris, because it was hoped he had
attained blessedness in the bosom of the god.”</p>

<p>Queen Tuaa stands behind her husband, and
Miss Edwards finds in her delicate but slightly
angular profile a resemblance to some of the portraits
of Queen Elizabeth. In Rameses II she
says “the beauty of the race culminates. The
artists of the Egyptian Renaissance, always great
in profile portraits, are nowhere seen to better
advantage than in this series.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>A statue of the Lady Nai, in the Louvre, may
give some idea of the dress of this period, the
nineteenth dynasty. She wears a long wig, with
a band round her head, a tight garment of linen,
not unlike the modern chemise, only narrower,
and a strip of linen hanging down in front.</p>

<p>This temple of El Kurneh is at the entrance
of the valley of the Tombs of the Kings, and the
cutting is called by the Arabs Bab-el-Molook,
“gate of the Sultan.” The road is narrow and
stony, its desert sands dazzling in the brilliant
sunshine, leading to a lonely and sepulchral glen,
honeycombed with the tombs of past dignitaries,
nobles, priests and monarchs.</p>

<p>Here and there, as we study the history of
Egypt, is a link with the Bible story, though
nothing very definite has yet been discovered. It
is believed by some writers that Moses and Aaron
lived in the age of Seti I, and that Moses was
brought up with the youthful Rameses II. Others
make the time somewhat later, and think that the
princess who rescued the deliverer of the Israelites
from the water was one of the many daughters
of the great Sesostris.</p>

<p>Thebes was probably Queen Tuaa’s principal
residence, and the palace saw many partings, since
with warriors for husband, sons and grandsons,
if the queen survived so long, they must have
been frequently absent, and she must needs have
passed some anxious hours. But so essentially
was war the trade of the monarchs of ancient
times, and in the lives of their female relatives
so much a matter of course, that it would seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
as if the feminine heart must have become somewhat
hardened. Doubtless the royal lady looked
forward to receiving a victor laden with spoils.
We almost seem to hear the burden of the refrain,
“Have they not sped, have they not divided
the prey, to every man a damsel or two, to Sisera
a prey of diverse colors of needlework on both
sides, meet for the necks of them that take the
spoil?” What matter to the conqueror, or even
to his consort, if thousands of lives paid the
price?</p>

<p>Seti I was “a man of blood,” and is spoken of
as “a jackal which rushes leaping through the
land, a grim lion that frequents the more hidden
paths of all regions, a powerful bull with a sharpened
pair of horns.” His chariot horses were
called “Amon gives him strength.” But if, in
Scripture language, he chastised the people “with
whips,” Rameses II, his son, “chastised them with
scorpions.”</p>

<p>Side by side with his father fought the youthful
hero, and we are reminded by them of a
similar pair in more modern history, Edward III
of England and the Black Prince. Chief among
the wars was that against Khita, or Hittites, from
which, as Queen Tuaa anticipated, Seti I returned
victorious. He came laden with rich booty, silver,
gold, blue, green, red and other precious stones.
At the frontier the priests, nobles and great men
met him with gifts and flowers—conqueror, as
he was reported to be, of thirteen peoples and
many cities. And we cannot doubt that the palace,
too, by Queen Tuaa’s orders, was specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
beautified and decorated with plants and flowers
in honor of the victor’s return. Booty and prisoners
were dedicated to the god Amon, his wife
Mut, and his son Khonsu.</p>

<p>Little, perhaps, did Queen Tuaa then imagine
that one of her daughters-in-law, a princess of
Khita, would be from among the conquered
people. But so it proved, when Rameses II
formed an alliance with the King of Khita and
took his daughter to wife; but Queen Tuaa may
not have lived to see the union, since Rameses
II in earlier times had probably already provided
himself with a wife.</p>

<p>Queen Tuaa must have viewed with interest, as
did Queen Mertytefs of the fourth dynasty, the
magnificent architectural works of her husband.
In one case a temple of the gods, which yet recorded
the king’s own power, and in the other
the tomb or monument which should keep before
the eyes of all future generations the name of its
builder. The temple lies largely in ruins, but the
older structure has withstood to a much greater
degree the ravages of time and the wanton destruction
of man.</p>

<p>The city of Thebes was magnificent with temples
and palaces, and was built on both sides of
the Nile, the flat plain stretched away to the
mountains, and against the blue of the cloudless
sky rose its towers and pylons, its colossal columns
and statues. Clusters or avenues of palms
lent a light but grateful shade from the sun’s unveiled
brightness, and added a touch of living
green to the azure of the firmament and creamy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
whiteness of some of the buildings. Others were
of different colors, giving a jewel-like effect at
a distance in the rays of the brilliant sun. In
some instances the trade or profession of the
owner was pictured on the front walls. The
streets were crowded with people; beasts of burden,
heavily laden, made their way slowly along.
Vendors of all sorts lined the sides of the street,
and a hubbub of voices rose constantly. In the
grander objects Nature had furnished the model,
the mountain summits suggested the form of the
pyramid and the caves of the Nile valley the
temples.</p>

<p>The temple of Luxor, or El Uksor, was near
the river, but faced from it toward that of Karnak,
and a long avenue of sphinxes, a mile in
extent, connected the two. What one king began,
another added to, and a third, perhaps, finished;
thus Seti I, and his, in some respects,
greater son, are, in their architectural works, constantly
associated, together. The sculpture of
Siti, however, is considered the finer. The interiors
of the temples were often gloomy and dim,
but at the summer solstice the sun penetrated to
the inner sanctuary of Karnak.</p>

<p>The grandeur of Karnak dwarfs that of Luxor,
and the Hypostyle Hall, built by Seti I for the
celebration of religious festivals, in which Queen
Tuaa may have taken part, is, even in its ruined
state, one of the wonders of the world. In recent
times some of the columns have fallen. The
temple was one hundred and seventy feet in
length, three hundred and twenty-nine in width,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and supported by one hundred and thirty-four columns,
as large in circumference, though not so
high, as the Vendome column in Paris. The central
lines are seventy feet in height and twelve
in diameter, while those on either side are forty
in height and nine in diameter. The effect of
the great hall with its forest of columns is awe-inspiring;
one writer after another describes
himself as empty of words and dumb before it.
No matter how familiar one may be with the
place from descriptions of it, previously read, this
remains true, just as the Taj Mahal, in India,
is to the eye of each new gazer a dream of beauty.
Says one writer: “Karnak is to Egyptian architecture
what the Parthenon is to Greek, the Pantheon
to Roman, and Notre Dame in Paris to
Medieval; but it is far grander than them all.”</p>

<p>Seti’s battles and Seti’s victories have passed
away, but Seti’s temple stands, eternal almost as
the mountains. Walls and columns were decorated
with sculptures, begun by the father, finished
by the son, those of Seti on the north, of
Rameses on the south wall. Those of Seti are
the finer, and represent the king in his chariot
doing battle with his enemies, while on the columns
both monarchs are presenting offerings to
the gods. The statues and the sacred lakes, which
formed part of the temple adjuncts, correspond in
size. At the present time this great temple is
spoken of as the greatest ruin in the world, the
crowning triumph of Egyptian art.</p>

<p>The winged disk, symbolizing the victory of
Horus over Typhon, was, by command of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
god Thoth, placed over all entrances. At the
gate of the temple of Karnak was a representation
of the coronation of Rameses I, father of a
celebrated son and more celebrated grandson. The
winter of 1897-8 saw the discovery of the tomb
of Osiris, and the god kings Horus and Set, remains
from the time of Seti I.</p>

<p>The name of the architect of the magnificent
Hypostile Hall is preserved, and the Glyptohek
in Munich possesses a statute of this Michael
Angelo of his time, as Miss Edwards calls him.
An old man with a beard, in a loose robe, sitting
upon the ground, lost in meditation. High priest
and first prophet of Amon under Seti, he became,
under Rameses, the chief architect of the Thebaid,
and royally commissioned to embellish the
temples. He was called Bak-en-Khonsu.</p>

<p>The oldest map in existence is said to be that
of a gold mine worked by Seti I, which furnished
perhaps some of the means for his great architectural
undertakings, but which was worked to
still better advantage by his son.</p>

<p>Seti I reigned about twenty-seven years, was
buried with great honors, and his memory was
kept fresh by the devotion of his son; but Queen
Ti, or Tuaa, though described on the monuments
as “royal wife, royal mother, and heiress and
sharer of the throne,” seems to fade out of sight,
perhaps dying before him, and the profile on the
wall remains to us the strongest image of her.</p>

<p>Seven hundred ushebti were said to have been
buried with Seti, images of slaves who were to
accompany and wait upon him in the land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Amenti. A curious little dialogue between master
and servants is preserved. The deceased says,
“O ye figures, be ye ever watchful to work, to
plough, to sow the fields, to water the canals and
to carry sand from the east and from the west.”
The figures reply, “Here am I when thou
callest.”</p>

<p>Seti’s name is given as “Ra-user-Kheperu-meri-Amen
Seb-Ra-Seti-Mer-en-ptah,” His tomb was
discovered by Belzoni in 1817, and is one of the
most beautiful ever found, the sarcophagus, in
which the body was originally placed, being of
the finest alabaster, delicately sculptured both outside
and within. This was eventually purchased
by an Englishman and rests in the Sloan Museum.
Seti is spoken of as the “justified,” and hence
had successfully passed the great tribunal to
which all the departed were subjected.</p>

<p>But the grave afforded no permanent resting-place
for the great monarch, warrior and builder.
His mummy, his veritable self, with that of his
son and many other kings and queens, is in the
museum at Gizeh. Even from these withered remains
we can judge that Seti was an unusually
handsome man. The Louvre contains a full-length
portrait of Seti I, cut out bodily from the
walls of the sepulchre in the Tombs of the Kings.
Placed in a tomb, from which he was removed
to that of Queen Ansera, for fear of robbers, it
was eventually broken into, and after other like
journeys and removals he is now the object of
the curious or interested gaze of the passing traveler.
The mummy is said to be one of the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
ever found, and clearly shows his claim to beauty,
even preserving to a certain degree the expression
of his face.</p>

<p>There is a figure of Seti I in the British Museum,
and smaller memorials of him in other collections,
among them the Metropolitan Museum
of New York. Of one of the paintings in his
tomb, Lady Duff Gordon says: “The face of the
goddess of the Western shore Amenti. Athar
or Hecate is ravishing, and she welcomes the king
to her regions; death was never painted so
lovely.” Was it possible that with the artist’s
conception of the goddess might mingle a memory
of the dead Queen Tuaa, with whom her royal
spouse had now joined company; we can but
surmise.</p>

<p>Turn we next to the consideration of the wives
of that much married man, Rameses II.</p>

<p>With the exception of Cleopatra, one or two
Ptolemy queens, Hatasu, and possibly Nitocris,
the history of Egypt which has come down to us
deals principally with the kings, and not with the
queens. The latter are mentioned incidentally,
or not at all, though holding a very different
place from the female sovereigns of other Eastern
nations, and the student explorer who endeavors
to vitalize these fragmentary and scattered
outlines has not an easy task.</p>

<p>In no case is the above more true than in that
of the wife or wives of Rameses II, the Sesostris
of the Greeks who waged tedious wars against
the Hittites, with whom he made peace in the
twenty-first year of his reign, and of whom Herodotus
speaks. It is the king whose striking
and heroic figure in childhood, youth and manhood,
occupies the foreground of the canvas,
dwarfing into comparative insignificance all who
stand near him, and leaving the details as regards
female relationships but as accessories and background.</p>

</div>

<p>Says an ardent Egyptologist, “One of the handsomest
of men, we come in time to recognize his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
face, with its haughty beauty, just as we
do that of Henry VIII or Louis XIV.”
Curtis speaks thus on the general subject: “Oriental
masculine beauty is so mild and feminine
that the men are like statues of men seen in the
most mellowing and azure atmosphere. The
forms of the face have a surprising grace and
perfection. They are not statues and gods so
seen, but the budding beauty of the Antinous
when he, too, had been in the soft climate, the
ripening rounding lip, the arched brow, the heavy,
drooping lid, the crushed, closed eye, like a bud
bursting with voluptuous beauty, the low broad
brow; these I remember at Asyoot and remember
forever.”</p>

<p>Much of this, perhaps, constituted the charm
of the youthful Rameses face, but to it must be
added something of the strength and intellect
which were often lacking.</p>

<p>From his mother, Queen Tuaa, Rameses II, of
the nineteenth dynasty, received the heritage of
royal ancestry; his father, Seti I, belonged to a
new family, who, in view of descent, had no claim
to the throne. So say most authorities, though
some dispute it. As a child, his father made him
co-ruler with himself. An inscription of Rameses
II reads, “I was a boy in his lap,” referring to
his father, “and he spoke thus, ‘I will have him
crowned as king, for I desire to behold his grandeur
while I am still alive.’” Officers then came
forward to place the crown on his head, and Seti
said: “Place the royal circlet on his brow.” After
this ceremony, however, he was still left in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
house of the women and royal concubines, but
was put in command of a band of Amazons,
“maidens who wore a harness of leather.” So that
soldier and conqueror though he so early became,
his associations from childhood up were constantly
with women, and for the sex in general his subsequent
conduct may lead us to infer he had a
special weakness.</p>

<p>Another inscription reads, “when thou wast a
boy with the youth locks of hair, no monument
saw the light without thy command, no business
was conducted without thy knowledge.” He laid
foundation stones even in childhood. Little wonder
that no prouder monarch ever held sway and
that we associate the idea of unwonted magnificence
with him and his queens.</p>

<p>“Rameses the Great, if he was as much like
his portraits as they are like each other, must have
been one of the handsomest men, not only of
his own day, but of all history,” says the enthusiastic
Miss Edwards. There is a bas-relief of
him during his first campaign as a beautiful youth
with “a delicate, Dantesque face.” Some years
later we see him at Abydos in the temple of Seti
I with a boyish beard. The likeness with which
we become most familiar, in the prime of life, is
thus described: “The face is oval, the eyes are
long, prominent and heavy-lidded, the nose
slightly aquiline and characteristically depressed
at the tip. The nostrils are open and sensitive,
the under lip projects, the chin is short and
square.”</p>

<p>It seems likely that it was true of Rameses II<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
as is said of the sailor, that he had a “sweetheart
in every port.” No woman could boast that she
alone reigned in his heart. Two, if not three,
wives were made his legal consorts, and he had
numerous concubines. The king’s name was
branded on female slaves that they could not escape
undiscovered.</p>

<p>Little or nothing is known of the queen’s previous
history; she may be said to have had no
childhood or youth as regards our story. As the
wife of Rameses II and the mother of his children
she first becomes known to us. Queen Nofritari
seems to have been his earliest consort,
probably his sister or the daughter of some Egyptian
noble. One writer, Pollard, gives authority
for considering her the princess who rescued
Moses, the daughter of the king, whom he subsequently
married; but as the king doubtless married
in his youth, and she is the first queen of
whom we find record, this seems unlikely. Says
the same writer, speaking of the temple of Luxor,
“Rameses the Great, some two hundred and thirty
years afterwards, added another large court,
which was surrounded by a double row of columns;
between these are gigantic statues of this
monarch, more or less perfect. One on the left
of the court is very beautiful, in most perfect
condition, and represents him as a young man.
The expression of the countenance is very pleasing.
By his side, her head reaching to his knee,
stands the diminutive but beautiful form of his
beloved Nefert-ari.”</p>

<p>The queen’s name, as usual, is variously spelled</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Nofritari-Minimut, Nefertari, Nofertuit-Meri-en
Mut, and Nofruari, and means, as did that of
Queen Nefertari-Aahmes, “good or beautiful companion.”
She shared her honors with a Khi-tan
princess, whose brief story is told in a later chapter,
and with another lady, Isis-Nefer.</p>

<p>Rameses II even lies under the suspicion of
having married two of his own daughters, Honuttani
and Bint-Antha, the latter whom Baedaker
speaks of as queen under the title of Bint-Anat,
and of a small statue of her standing by
the knee of a larger one of Rameses II, of whom
he was known to be especially fond. It is this
princess who is made the heroine of Ebers’ story
of “Uarda,” but she is here provided with a more
suitable lover, while Rameses himself is depicted
as a more noble character than is perhaps quite
warranted by the historical records. So true,
however, are Professor Ebers’ stories to the ascertained
facts in each case, that, as a rule, they may,
serve as admirable historical studies, quite aside
from any merit they may possess as artistic works
of fiction.</p>

<p>Jewish tradition mentions a certain Princess
Moeris (which some writers have believed to be
one of Rameses II’s youngest children, the Princess
Meri) as the one who rescued Moses in infancy,
as above referred to.</p>

<p>Pictures and inscriptions give the number of
Rameses II’s children as sixty sons and fifty-nine
daughters, and one enumeration even reaches to
one hundred and seventy-one children. Some of
Rameses’ daughters were Meri Amun, Beken-Mut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Noferari, Nebtani and Isiemkheb, of whom
Meri-Amun and Neb-tani, in addition to Houttani,
and Bint-Antha are marked as queens in the
family list, probably the wives of their brothers
or near relatives.</p>

<p>On the walls of the temple at Deir Champollion
found an imperfect list of these sons and daughters.
As a curiosity one may cite the different
dates assigned by historians as the beginning of
the reign of Rameses II: Brugsch, B. C. 1407;
Mariette, 1405; Lepsius, 1388; Bunson, 1352, and
Poole, 1283.</p>

<p>Since his son was of the blood royal, it was
the policy of Seti I to unite him with himself, as
has been shown, in the government of the kingdom,
thus pacifying all adherents to the old regime,
and Queen Tuaa, from whom Rameses II
derived his “blue blood,” appears in the family
group. The attachment between this father and
son is an attractive feature of their joint reigns,
and reminds one of the similar bond between
Thothmes I and his daughter Hatasu. In peace
and war Seti and Rameses were ever side by
side. Together they governed, together they took
their pleasure and rode forth, each in his royal
chariot, to fight and to conquer.</p>

<p>At Abydos, Karnak and other places are pictures
of the prince; in one of them, adorned with
the priestly panther skin, he is pouring libations on
the altar in front of him, while his father holds
a censor; according to these same representations
and many inscriptions in the various temples
adorned with his statues, the youthful Rameses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
performed prodigies of valor in the field. In the
little temple of Betel-Wali are shown, on the
right wall, the victories of Rameses II over the
Libyans and Syrians, and on the left, over the
Ethiopians. He was a “Black Prince” for whom
the hand of fate did not lay out a brief career.
The delight of his father’s heart, he lived to assume
the full government and to pay royal honors
in that beloved parent.</p>

<p>Like his ancestor Amenophis III, Rameses II
seems to have had a passion for lions, not so
much for the sport of hunting them as to train
them for pets or instruments of warfare. Doubtless
there was something that specially ministered
to the pride of the haughty monarch in these
favorites, known as the lion has ever been as “the
king of beasts,” the “monarch of the forest,” etc.</p>

<p>Whether the queen shared his partiality we are
not told, but since they were his playthings and
his companions, she must have accepted them in a
measure, if with a trembling heart. His favorite
lion lay at the door of the king’s tent and went
forth with him to the battlefield, probably at
times even set loose to slay and destroy the enemy.
The wall paintings show the king’s lions in various
places.</p>

<p>There is something both attractive and repellant
in this figure of the proud, handsome, vainglorious
monarch, in the full vigor of his manhood,
accompanied by this dangerous ally and
slave. The tale of the lion and the mouse, Esop’s
well known fable, is said to be of Egyptian origin,
and within the last forty or fifty years many romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
stories and many love tales of the Egyptians
have come to light.</p>

<p>A more modern character, Sir Henry Rawlinson,
who wrote much on Egypt and also a great
authority on Persian inscriptions, shared with
this ancient king his taste for barbarous pets. He
brought up a young lion who followed him
around like a dog and lay at his feet when he
wrote and studied. He also made such a pet of
a leopard that it knew him after long separation,
and displayed pleasure at his presence, when he
visited the Zoological Garden in England, to
which he had given it. The story goes that he
put his hand into the cage when the keeper, who
did not know him, exclaimed: “Take your hand
out of the cage! The animal is very savage and
will bite you!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he will bite me,” said Sir Henry,
“will you Fahad?” and the beast answered with
a purr and would hardly let the hand be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Queen Nefritare-Minimut was the first, the
chief, and the best beloved, there seems little
question, of the wives of Rameses II, since it is
her picture that appears with that of the king in
various places and she is termed “Beloved Companion.”
Maspero gives a picture of her in her
chariot, following the king and says, “Still a
young woman with delicate, regular features already
faded and wrinkled under her powder.
Like her husband she wears a long robe, its folds,
through the rapid motion, floating behind her.”
There is a large escort and every one stands in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
a chariot driven by a groom. This queen was
the mother of a number of children, who, in the
temple of Abou Simbel, elsewhere called Ibsamboul,
are grouped with her. We may accord her
some charm of beauty since the monarch of that
time selected his wife, not from a list of foreign
princesses of suitable rank, but from among the
children of his own nobles, or relatives, with
whose attractions he could become more readily
acquainted. More than one writer speaks of the
queen’s figure being full of grace and her features
refined and attractive in her pictures.</p>

<p>There are two temples at Abou Simbel, translated
“Father of the Corn” or “Father of the
Sickle,” excavated in the solid rock. The larger
has statues chiefly of the king, though there are
smaller ones of his mother, wife and some of his
children. The smaller, of the queen also of equal
size with her husband, and smaller ones of some
of their sons and daughters. These are the most
familiar effigies of Rameses II and Nofritare-Minimut
together, the male figure being full of
spirit, the female of grace. “Rameses, the Strong
in Truth, the beloved of Amen,” says the outer
legend, “made this divine abode for his wife,
Nefertari, whom he loves.” Within the words
are “his royal wife, who loves him, Nefertari, the
beloved of Maut, constructed for him this abode
in the mountain of Pure Waters.”</p>

<p>Curtis says, “In these faces of Rameses, seven
feet long, is a godlike grandeur and beauty
which the Greeks never reached—the mind cannot
escape the feeling that they were conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
by colossal minds. Such only cherish the idea
of repose so profound—their beauty is steeped
in a placid passion that seems passionless. In
those earlier days Art was not content with the
grace of Nature, but coped with its proportions.
Vain attempt, but glorious!”</p>

<p>Miss Edwards was present and took part in
the discovery of some portions of this edifice and
describes the occurrences and her sensations with
her usual picturesqueness and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>On the inner north wall there is a picture, presumably
of Queen Nofritari, with a blue head-dress
and disk, in her right hand the ankh or
life sign and in her left a jackal-headed sceptre.
Vases of a blue color stand on a table of offerings
near.</p>

<p>It is at this temple that we know Rameses best,
fifteen or twenty years later than the pictures of
him before described. Here, to quote from the
same author, he has “outlived the rage of early
youth and become implacable. God-like serenity,
superhuman pride, immutable will breathe from
the stone. He has learned to believe his power
irresistible and himself divine.”</p>

<p>The queen wears the plumes and disk of
Hathor and has her daughters with her. She
has much sweetness and grace if not positive
beauty.</p>

<p>The colossi are difficult to see but the southernmost
may be best viewed in profile on a sand
slope level with the beard. Even the great cast
in the British Museum cannot be well seen. The
temple at Abou Simbel has one hall and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
large chambers. The colossi are placed two to
the right and two to left of the door; they are
sixty feet high without the platform and measure
across the chest twenty-five feet four inches. The
figures are sealed, but if standing would be
eighty-three feet high. Little dimples giving
sweetness to the corners of the mouth and, tiny
depressions in the lobe of the ear, are as large
as saucers. The most southward statue is best
preserved. The next statue is shattered to the
waist, the head lying in the sand, at its feet. The
third is nearly perfect. The fourth has lost
beard, uraeus and arms, and has a hole in front.
The heads are worked out, the bodies generalized.
The figures are naked to the waist, and clothed
below in the usual striped tunic. They wear the
double crown, rich collars, no sandals or bracelets,
and there are holes in the stone which may have
held bronze or gold belts. The cartouches of the
king are on his breast, and arm, having been probably
tatooed upon his person. The statues are
executed in a light vein of rock and were, it is
likely, not painted, like those of Siva’s temple in
Elephantine, in India. Above the door is a twenty-foot
statue of Ra and on either side a portrait
of the king in bas relief.</p>

<p>The smaller temple has six statues, three on
each side of the door, over thirty feet high, the
King and Queen Nofritari. The king is crowned
with the pashent, and uraeus and wears a fantastic
helmet, adorned with plumes and horns.
He has some of his sons, she her daughters with
her, ten feet in height, reaching to the knees of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
their parents. The names of the royal consorts
appear on every pillar and on every wall, with the
statement that affection unites them. The queen
is seen on the facade as the mother of six children
and adorned with the attributes of a goddess.
The king is attended by captives of different
nations. The temple seems to have been
left unfinished. The larger temple is within
twenty-five yards of the brink of the river, the
smaller within as many feet. They are of different
shades of yellow.</p>

<p>In some of the pictures the figures wear pectoral
ornaments and a rich necklace, with alternate
vermilion and black drops, and a golden yellow
belt, studded with red and black stones. The
throne is on a blue platform, painted in stripes,
red, blue and white. The platform is decorated
with gold colored stars and tan crosses, picked out
with red. Amon-Ra, the god whom they worship,
is here represented with a blue-black complexion,
a corselet of gold chain, armor, and a
head-dress of towering plumes. On the altar is a
blue lotus with a red stalk, and a vessel with a
spout like a coffee pot. There are as many
varieties of this god in Egypt as of the Madonna
in Italy and Spain.</p>

<p>An earthquake in the time of Rameses II may
have accounted for the partial overthrow of the
statues on the outside of the temple. The cast
of a stele in the Louvre states that Rameses II
made artesian wells in the desert.</p>

<p>In one of the pictures of the queen she advances
with two sistra, the sacred instrument introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
in the Fourth Dynasty, time of Mertytefs.
This consists of a frame, somewhat oval
in shape, with bars across, strung with rings,
which slipped up and down. We can fancy the
music produced to be rather Chinese in character
and not such as would appeal to Western ears as
charming. The priestess of the god was the
“divine wife,” or the “divine handmaid,” a position
of great honor, even for the queen. The
handle of the sistrum in the oldest times was always
cow-eared and ornamented with the head
of Hathor, the Egyptian Venus.</p>

<p>One of the goddesses to whom the queen is
paying honor is Ta-ur-t, who has the face of a
woman on the body of a hippopotamus. She
wears a wig, and a robe of state with five capes,
described as a cross between that of a Lord Chancellor
and a coachman. Behind the goddess
stand the gods Thoth and Nut.</p>

<p>Thebes was no doubt the chief residence of
Queen Nofritari, Tunis that of the Khitan
Princess; the king’s enormous domestic establishments
probably being in different places. There
is a story, who can tell whether it be founded on
fact? that the king and queen, by the treacherous
dealing of one of the king’s relatives, were shut
up in a certain city which was then set on fire,
the intriguer doubtless intending to usurp the
throne, and that at the queen’s suggestion some
of the king’s sons formed their bodies into a
bridge by which he might escape, some of them
suffering death in consequence.</p>

<p>The great Thebes is said to have been as large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
as London. On the Eastern bank, the Arabian
side of the Nile, stand Karnak and Luxor. On
the western or Lybian bank, Goornah, the
Rameseum and Medinet Haboo. The Rameseum,
a palace and temple combined, faces about
half way between Karnak and Luxor. Medinet
Haboo is further to the south than any building
on the east side of the river. Behind the western
group is the great Theban Metropolis, along the
Lybian range, further back in radiating valleys,
are the Tombs of the Kings. Between Karnak
and Luxor is a little less than two miles, from
Medinet Haboo to Goornah something under
four.</p>

<p>The prostrate statue of Rameses II, near Memphis,
so long covered with Nile mud, repeats the
lineaments of the Abou Simbel statue. This
colossus kept vigil at the gate of the temple and
is serene and dignified, even in its overthrow; it
is of Syenite and probably stood in front of the
temple of Ptah, mentioned both by Herodotus
and Diodorus. Says a poetic writer, “I fancy
the repose of that court in a Theban sunset, the
windless stillness of the air, and cloudlessness of
the sky. The king enters, thoughtfully pacing by
the calm browed statue, that seems the sentinel
of heaven. In the presence of the majestic
columns, humanly carved, their hands sedately
folded upon their breasts—his weary soul is
bathed with peace, as a weary body with living
water.” This statue is one of the most pleasing
of the many likenesses of Rameses II, and a cast
of it has been taken. Mariette said “the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
modelled with a grandeur of style which one
never tires of admiring, is an authentic portrait
of the celebrated conqueror of the Nineteenth
Dynasty.”</p>

<p>The pre-nomen of Rameses II was “Ra-usr-mat-setep-en-Ra,”
“Sun strong in Truth, approved
of the Sun, son of the Sun, Beloved of
Amon.” The foot is eleven feet by four feet ten
inches, and on the peristyle is inscribed, “I am
Osymandies, King of Kings. If any would know
how great I am and where I lie, let him excel
me in any of my works.”</p>

<p>The passion for building, characteristic of many
Egyptian kings, was specially strong in the father
and son, Seti I and Rameses II, and the latter
completed many structures begun by the former.
To Seti I are credited the grand temple of Osiris
at Abydos, the temple and palace of Karnak at
Thebes, and his tomb, which is said to excel those
of the other Theban kings in its sculpture, colored
decorations and alabaster sarcophagi. But his
Hypostyle Hall at Karnak exceeds them all.</p>

<p>To Rameses II are credited many architectural
works along the Nile, from the Delta to the capital
of Ethiopia. The list comprises the splendid
rock temples at Abou Simbel, in Nubia, just described,
the Rammesium or Memnonium, called
by Diodorus “the tomb of Osymandius,” on the
walls of which are sculptured the story of
Rameses’ reign, large portions of the temple
palaces of Karnak and Luxor, before which last
stands the column whose mate is now in the
Place de la Concorde in Paris, a small temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
at Abydos, and various works in the Fayum, at
Memphis and at Tunis, of which last he was especially
fond. In nothing apparently did he take
more delight than in erecting gigantic statues of
himself.</p>

<p>To accomplish these great architectural designs
required an immense army of workmen
and no monarch was more ruthless in his expenditure
of human life. Some have believed
that to this period belongs in large part the
slavery of the Hebrews, whose cries reached the
very ears of Heaven and it is said that he deported
whole tribes to accomplish his purposes.
History repeats itself; as in the earlier reigns,
during the structure of the pyramids, and Queen
Nofritari Minimut, like Queen Mertytefs, must
have witnessed much suffering and viewed it
perhaps with a like indifference. Proud of her
husband’s deeds and accomplishments, what mattered
the cost of such monuments. Of little more
value than an insect’s life was that of the innumerable
slaves that bowed, trembled and toiled
at the great monarch’s command. We can believe
that the sound of the taskmaster’s whip
woke no echo of pity in that haughty breast. Devotion
to the gods, exultation in her husband,
more or less passionate devotion to her children,
these left no room for the consideration of the
life and sorrows of a slave.</p>

<p>So the curtain drops over the queen in the
zenith of her powers, and we hear the tinkle of
her sistrum, faintly, faintly down the centuries.
Priestess, queen, wife, mother, statue, shadow—thus
she stands smiling stonily, yet sweetly, on
succeeding ages. Rich in this world’s goods, beloved
of Heaven. Yet did she, too, exclaim with
Solomon, “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!” Who
can tell?</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_16">CHAPTER SIXTEENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">UR-MAA-NOFRU-RA.</span></h2>

<p>The many wived Rameses II, if so he was, did
not adopt Blue Beard’s plan of despatching one
before he espoused another, but merely set up
separate establishments for each, and so preserved
the peace. The king could do no wrong in those
days, his divine right never being questioned, and
it may be doubted whether the first wife was surprised
at, or even objected to, the arrangement.
It was an early form of Mormonism and accepted
without protest.</p>

<p>While Queen Nofritari-Minimut was, there is
little question, first and chief wife, and probably
had been so for many years, and also the mother
of a number of children, the Keetan princess, and
perhaps others, shared the honor of being legal
consort.</p>

<p>We know little about the marriage ceremonials
of the Egyptians, compared to our very full
knowledge of their funeral rites, but a late writer
thus describes a wedding which may in part resemble
that used by the kings. “At the temple
the people remained outside the walls, while the
bride and groom, the pharaoh and dignitaries, entered
the hall of columns. There Hebron (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
bride) burned incense before the veiled statue
of Amon, priestesses performed a sacred dance
and Tutmosis (the groom) read the following
act from a papyrus:</p>

<p>“‘I, Tutmosis, commander of the guard of his
holiness Rameses XIII, take thee, Hebron,
daughter of Antefa, the monarch of Thebes, to
wife, as wife—I give thee now the sum of ten
talents, because thou hast consented to marry me.
For thy robes I designate to thee three talents
yearly, and for household expenses one talent a
month. Of the children which we may have the
eldest son will be heir to the property, which I
possess now, and which I may acquire hereafter,
if I should not live with thee, but divorce myself
and take another wife, I shall be obliged to pay
thee forty talents, which sum I secure with my
property. Our son on receiving his estate is to
pay thee fifteen talents yearly. Children of another
wife are to have no right to the property
of our first-born son.’</p>

<p>“The chief judge appeared now and read an act
in which the bride promised to give good food
and raiment to her husband, to care for his
house, family, servants, slaves and cattle, and
to entrust to that husband the management of
the property which she had received, or would
receive, from her father.</p>

<p>“After the facts were read Herhor gave Tutmosis
a goblet of wine. The bridegroom drank
half, the bride moistened her lips with it, and
then both burned incense before the purple curtain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Leaving the temple of Amon the young couple
and their splendid retinue passed through the
avenue of sphinxes, to the pharaoh’s palace.
Crowds of people and warriors greeted them with
shouts, scattering flowers on their pathway.”</p>

<p>The experience of this same Khitan or Chetan
princess, who adopted the name of Ur-maa-nofru-ra,
or, as given in other places, Noferura-Urmda
and Ra-maa-nofre, “Sun, Truth, Beautiful
exceedingly,” reminds one of that of Maria
Louisa of Austria, who became the wife of Napoleon
First of France. The father of each had
to bow the neck to the conqueror, the daughter
became in a sense the hostage, she paid the penalty
of defeat. There could not but have been a
sense of bitterness at such a fate, in which love
could have had no share. How far did ambition,
the feeling of being the wife of the greatest monarch
of the then known world, satisfy the empty
heart?</p>

<p>Among Rameses II’s numerous children his favorites
are known to have been his son, Khamus,
and his daughter, Bint-Antha, both perhaps the
children of Nofritari-Minimut, though one writer
gives Isemofer, probably not a legal consort, as
the mother of Khamus. We do not know the
names of the children of the Khitan princess or
even if she had any. A picture of a number of his
sons and daughters, with names attached, the
sons with fans, the daughters with sistra, is between
Elephantine and Abou Simbel.</p>

<p>Among the pictures of his children are those of
the Ramessium at Thebes, where Khamus, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
favorite son, is represented in a battle. There
are two processions of his children and in one,
two princesses. The eldest son of the Pharaoh
was called “Prince of Cush,” as the eldest son
of the king of England is now called “Prince of
Wales.”</p>

<p>“Sutem-hemt” was the royal wife, “Sutem-Mut,”
the royal mother, as such in the prime of
life we see Queen Nofritari-Minimut. Queen
Urm-maa-nofru-ra appears only in her beautiful
youth, as the bride; she herself, says one inscription,
“knew not the impression her beauty made
on the heart of the king.” In a novel founded
on this part of Egyptian history a queen is thus
described, “her eyes were the color of her hair, a
rich sunny brown, like Syriac women of Damascus.
On her head the double diadem of Thebes
and Memphis, the inner crown a graceful conical
bonnet of white silk, terminating in a knob like a
pomegranite bud. Outside a rich band of gold
and lined with red silk; red, the special color of
Lower, as white was of Upper Egypt; this was
open at the top and worn over the other. Then
a necklace of precious stones, with a clasp of a
vulture, his neck encircled by an asp, emblem of
the goddess, Maut. She wore a white vestment
of gauzy Persian silk, enriched with gold and
blue needlework below the waist, and secured by
a girdle blazing with diamonds. A long royal robe
from the Damascus looms descended to her feet.”
Some such outline perhaps conveys an idea of
the new queen. Not an exact portrait, but a mere
suggestion, helpful in filling in our mosaic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Beautiful we may believe her to have been, and
much the junior of the man she must needs accept
for a husband. She was never allowed to
forget the cost at which her honors were bought,
however; on many walls of temples and perhaps
palaces also, the painted record stared her in the
face. Yet did the conqueror regard his adversary,
Khitazar or Khitasar, king or prince of the
Khitans (by some believed to be the Hittites of
the Scriptures or, accord to others, the Aramaeans),
as no mean foe and the compact of
peace between them, which was engraved on a
silver tablet, was honorable to both. King
Khitazar seems to have inspired Rameses II with
more respect than some of his adversaries, on
whom he looked down with the utmost contempt.
It is said that he refused an offer of marriage for
one of his daughters from a Mesopotamian prince
or king, stating that he would not give his daughter
to a “nobody.”</p>

<p>The vanquished Kitazar offered his daughter
to the victor, who accepted this marriage as a
means of cementing the alliance between them.
Rameses had married Nofritari-Minimut, who is
spoken of as the “great princess, of every grace
in her heart, the beloved palm, mistress of both
lands, beloved of the king and united with the
ruler,” before the death of his father, Seti I, Ur-maa-nofru-ra
years after. The queen’s establishments
were far apart, probably they seldom or
never met, but doubtless Queen Nofritari-Minimut
held proudly to her position as first consort.
Both queens must have had some acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
with the king’s singular and dangerous pet, the
lion, who fought with him in his battle against
the Khita, one of which is named in the picture
in which he accompanied the king, “Smaru-khef-tu-f,”
“the tearer in pieces.”</p>

<p>According to most authorities the marriage of
Rameses II and Ur-maa-nofru-ra took place in
the fifth year of the king’s sole reign. Near the
temple of Abou-Simbel there is a passage in the
rocks, where there is a picture of Rameses II, sitting
under a canopy, between two gods, while before
him appears the Khitan princess, followed
by her father, Kitazar, in the dress of his country.
The princess’ name is enclosed with that
of Rameses II in a royal cartouche, which shows
her to have been his legal consort. The stele
celebrating this event was probably put up in the
34th year of his reign, a number of years after
the marriage.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most ancient international treaty
in the world, which differs little from those of
modern times, is this concordat established between
Rameses II and Kitazar, which was intended
to put an end to the wars between the
Egyptians and Asiatics. On the side wall of the
temple of Amon at Karnak it is given in an inscription.
It is dated 21st Tybi, in 21st year of
Rameses II Miamun, in the town of Tanis and
was engraved on a silver tablet and brought by
ambassadors of peace. After speaking of the
fact that there had been peace between their ancestors
at one time, it goes on to say, “Khetasar,
prince of the Khita, unites with Rameses Miamun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the mighty king of Egypt, to cause to exist
between them good peace and good alliance, from
this time on forever. He shall be allied with
me, he shall be at peace with me. And I, I shall
be allied with him, and I, I shall be at peace with
him forever.” Many pictures of the battles which
preceded this agreement of peace are also to be
seen on the temple walls.</p>

<p>Rameses II’s reign was also something of an
Elizabethan age in Egyptian literature. A number
of old works on papyrus have been found,
left by a galaxy of Theban writers. History,
divinity, practical philosophy, poetry and tales are
among them. A list of temple scribes is given,
naming Bek-en-tah, Qu-ge-bu, Hor Anna, Mer-Em-aput,
Amen-em-api, Pan and Pentaur. The
victorious campaign of Rameses II against the
Ethiopians is described by Herodotus, who perhaps
derived his authority from some of these
sources. Pentaur, sometimes spoken of as the
jovial poet, was easily laureate of this reign. In
high, joyful, but martial strains, he celebrated, in
heroic verse, the achievements of his master. He
glorifies his every deed and makes him a demi-god
rather than a man. Again and again
Rameses II had Pentaur’s poem, the so-called
Iliad of the Egyptians, inscribed on the temple
walls. To the east of the southern door, near
the great Hall of Columns at Karnak, the poem
is to be found. At Abydos, Luxor, Karnak, the
Ramessium, on the inner face of the pylon at the
Ramessium, and at the Memnonium or tomb of
Osymandeus and Abou-Simbel the same familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
scene of Rameses fighting alone is pictured or
described. The king is shown in a chariot with
prancing horses, and again on a throne with the
inscription, “Victory for Thebes.” Four of these
copies of the poem are perfect, at Abydos, Luxor
and Abou-Simbel, a fifth, without illustration, is
on the wall of the temple of Karnak and a fragment
at the temple of Deir in Nubia.</p>

<p>“Where art thou, O father Amon!” prays the
king, “Does a father forsake his son? Not one
of my generals, not one of my captains is with
me.” “I hasten to thine aid, O Rameses, my son,
beloved of Amon,” answers the god and singly
and alone enables him to perform prodigies of
valor. “My soldiers have abandoned me, my
horsemen have fled,” cries the king. “I am more
to thee than hundreds of thousands,” comes the
response and again, “the youthful king with his
bold hand has not his equal. His arms are powerful,
his heart is firm. His courage is like that of
the god of war.” Again the king speaks. “The
diadem of the royal snake adorns my head. It
spits fire and glowing flame in the face of my
enemies. They cried out to one another, ‘Take
care! Do not fall, for the powerful snake of
royalty has placed itself on his horse.’” The
great temple of Abou-Simbel is said by some to
have been made in honor of his first victory over
the Khitans, years before his marriage with the
princess. “The freshness of the statues there,”
says Curtis, “is startling. It is sublime.”</p>

<p>All these laudations gratified the king’s pride,
for the little queen there must have been in it all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
something of a trial. But it was not a time distinguished
for consideration of the feelings of
others. For her the old life was probably closed;
there was not likely to have been much intercourse,
merely for her pleasure, between her and
her family. For purposes of war, and perhaps
for hunting, they went far afield, but we can well
believe that few trips to a distance, solely for the
pleasure of the ladies, were undertaken.</p>

<p>Innumerable are the pictures and statues of
Rameses II. Alone, with Queen Nofritare-Minimut
and his sons and daughters, and in one or
two places with his wife, the Khitan princess.
At Gibel Silsileh, on a tablet, is a picture of the
king, Queen Nofritari Minimut, Queen Tuaa or
Ti, the king’s mother, and the princess Bint-antha,
all appear in a bas-relief. Again the king
appears before the gods Ptah and Nefertum. A
stele in the third year of the reign of Rameses
II gives the route to the gold mines which
Rameses had worked. In the rock temple of
Gerf Husen the king appears as a founder and
god to be worshipped. In the half rock temple
of Sebuah is a large statue of him. At the temple
of Deir there is another picture of him. On the
stele of a certain General Amenti, near Abou-Simbel
appears Prince Seti, named, of course, for
the father of Rameses II, the king’s mother and
the Princess Bint Antha. There are, or were,
enormous statues of the king at Karnak, Tanis,
and elsewhere.</p>

<p>To the British Museum and other places in
Europe some of these statues have been removed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and among those in this country may be named
one in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania.
In the museum of Gizeh is a red granite
figure of Rameses II, life size, as a youth, at
eighteen or twenty, crowned with an elaborate
Osirian helmet, issuing from a diadem, encircled
by uraei; this known as the atef-crown.</p>

<p>The Hebrews, some believe to have been the
slaves who built for Rameses II the treasure
cities of Pithon and Rameses, the Pa-Tum and
Pa-Rameses of the inscriptions, and bricks made
with stubble, or no straw, have been found, confirming,
it is thought, the Bible record. The
Egyptian kings, bent on leaving behind them
such mammoth structures, all worked with a
reckless expenditure of the lives of their slaves
and captives.</p>

<p>Some of the pictures on tombs give representations
of conquered peoples, such as the brown and
coal black people of the Soudan, their princess
in a chariot drawn by oxen and shaded by an
umbrella, her attendants with feathers in their
hair and a kind of hood, like that worn by some
wild tribes in the present day.</p>

<p>Rameses II instituted several festivals, among
which may be mentioned that of the Nile and
that of Seknet and the goddess Bast at Bubastis,
where joyous and licentious festivals, like those
of Hathor, at Denderah, were held. At the former
festival the king was seated on a throne,
borne by twelve nobles, adorned with feathers,
the throne having the back and feet of a lion.
The king wore a war helmet and carried a staff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Behind were the court officials, warding off the
sun’s rays, with the long-handled flabellium,
while the lower order of priests, the Kherheb,
carried and swung censors of incense. Trains of
captives followed and the king was hailed as
“Rameses Miamun, who loves the Nile, the father
of the gods, his creator.”</p>

<p>As the Nile rose lights were lighted like beacon
fires at different points, till the whole country
was a blaze of joyful illumination. To the inhabitants
the rising of the Nile meant in great
degree life, health and happiness. A hymn sung
to celebrate this desired event is vouched for by
Glovatski, who has evidently made a close study
of his subject, as authentic. “Be greeted, O Nile,
sacred river, which appearest on this country!
Thou comest in peace to give life to Egypt. O
hidden deity, who scatterest darkness, who moistenest
the fields to bring food to dumb animals,
O thou precious one, descending from heaven to
give drink to the earth, O friend of bread, thou
who gladdenest our cottages! Thou art the master
of fishes; when thou art in our fields no bird
dares touch the harvest. Thou art the creator
of grain and the parent of barley; thou givest
rest to the hands of millions of the unfortunate
and for ages thou securest the sanctuary.” In
some such words as these rose to the blue heavens
the praise and acclaim of the grateful people.</p>

<p>In the month Paofi, the second half of July,
the waters are rising as much as two hands a day,
so that the waves in a continuous murmur may
be heard plashing over soil dry in the morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
while the color changes from greenish white to
a ruddy tint. Then growing darker, as in the
month Hator, including part of August, it has
reached half its height, and where men previously
walked they now travel in boats from the
middle of September to the middle of October,
the month Cheoeak, the waters at their height began
to fall, while trees blossomed a second time,
and fruits were gathered in the gardens. For the
next month, Tobi, the waters would continue to
fall disclosing more and more of the rich and
fructified earth. While the winter season, the
most delightful in Egypt, was beginning, the heat
rarely going beyond 70 Fahrenheit. As the month
Mechir advanced more and more land appeared
and flowers of varied hue sprang up amid the
emerald green of the fresh grass. By Phaenoth,
part of December, and January, the whole land
was abloom. No wonder the heavens rang with
the acclaim of the people who witnessed this daily
miracle.</p>

<p>Bubastis was the goddess Aphrodite of foreigners,
represented with the head of a lion or
cat. The cat was sacred to this goddess and said
to have honorable burial here. Indeed a regular
cat cemetery, filled with the remains of mummied
felines, has been found. The feast was held at
what corresponds to our Christmas time, and
Herodotus thus describes it. “When the Egyptians
travel to Bubastis they do it in this manner.
Men and women sail together and in each boat
there are many persons of both sexes. Some of
the women make a noise with rattles and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
blow pipes during the whole journey, while the
other men and women sing and clap their hands.
If they pass a town on the way they lay to and
some of the women land and shout and mock
at the women of the place, while others dance and
make a disturbance. They do this at every town
that lies on the Nile and when they arrive at
Bubastis they begin the festival with great sacrifices
and on this occasion more wine is consumed
than during the whole of the rest of the year.
All the people of both sexes, except children,
make a pilgrimage thither, 700,000 persons in all,
as the Egyptians assert.” In these festivals both
queens probably, separately or together, took a
share.</p>

<p>Amen-Ra was the patron deity of Rameses II,
but he also paid homage to Sutech in honor probably
to his Khitan wife, as this was chiefly confined
to Tanis, where we may believe Ur-maa-nofru-ra
resided. The god is represented with
the head-dress of a Khitan prince. Whatever
travelling she may have done, whatever her experiences,
Tanis was home to this queen, while
the city grew in magnificence and she watched
the erection of a grand temple to the god of her
fathers, some proof at least that she held a high
place in Rameses’ affection and regard.</p>

<p>The name Thebes is of Greek origin, as are
many of the Egyptian places, our knowledge of
the country being in so large a part derived from
the Greeks. Tanis also was so named by the
Greeks. This formerly great city, of which now
only mounds, ruins, etc., remain, was variously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
known as Tanis, Zoan, or San, the last of Arab
designation. It is believed by some authorities
to be the Zoan of the Bible, where the miracles
were performed. Its history is now told by
broken statues, mounds, tombs and hieroglyphics.
Scarcely one stone remains upon another. It is
in the Delta of the Nile and is called in some
of the inscriptions, “The Place of the Leg,” “The
Winged Disk of the North,” and “The Cradle
of Lower Egypt.” It was an old city when
Rameses II occupied and embellished it. He
never hesitated to pull down and use the materials
with which his predecessors had builded,
nor to smooth out their cartouches and replace
them with his own. Why should he, the greatest
monarch the world had ever known, as he doubtless
thought himself, shrink from taking his full
rights or even obliterating the name and fame of
some more insignificant ancestor. And devoted
as he seemed to have been to his father’s memory,
he even did the like occasionally with his father’s
signature.</p>

<p>The monumental history of Tanis, it is said,
begins with the Twelfth Dynasty, a fine broken
statue of Amenemhat I having been found. Then
follow memorials of later times. Superb statues
of the Hyksos period have also been discovered.
Of the work of Rameses II it is quoted that “he
found the place given over to the abomination
of desolation, he left it one of the most magnificent
of Egyptian cities.” For this purpose he
laid all Egypt under contribution, red granite
and black from Syene, and the Valley of Hammamat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
sandstone and limestone from Silsilis and
Toorah. His great temples to the gods were
but as the parchment on which he inscribed the
story of his own victories. It was the spirit of
the Pharisee which said, ‘I am not as other men
are.’</p>

<p>Wars and fires at different times have done
much to obliterate Tanis and its records as well
as to destroy all traces of it. Mr. Petrie, who,
like many archeologists, spares neither strength
nor effort to bring to light the history of the
past, with the true lover’s fervency in his favorite
pursuit, which is to be a gain not to himself, but
to the world, and Miss Edwards, who to a close
study of the old ruins and remains, adds a charming
power of picturesque description, have both
told much of Tanis. We condense their accounts
of the city at this past era. The Nile was alive
with vessels, the banks bordered with towns and
villas, the land beyond occupied by villages. The
great temple, which looked like a fortress, was
half a mile from the shore, and approached by a
fine road, in part bordered by sphinxes and the
city entered by a massive gateway. Gigantic
statues of the king alternated with sphinxes, the
last statue being fourteen times the size of a man.
There was a grand avenue bordered by columns,
thirty-six feet in height. Pylons, statues, obelisks,
a very forest of them—the tribute of the
previous centuries, many of them, to the present
king. Through these passed many processions,
the king, his son and officials, his warriors and
his captives. He, with the double crown on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
head, and glittering with jewels, the leopard skin
over his shoulders, to be received by the priests,
with divine honors, amid the plaudits and adulation
of the people. All to the sound of the harp
and flute, cimbals and sistrum. The queen doubtless
looking, from some gorgeously decorated
point of vantage when she did not personally
share in the pageant.</p>

<p>This was the home of the young queen, these
the magnificent sights to which her eyes were
accustomed. Parts of private letters on parchment
and on pottery have been found, telling
familiarly of the feasts and festivals, the expenses
and the daily incidents of the life of this period.
And the love stories and other fragments of fiction
which have, come down to us also give their
share of local color.</p>

<p>The last forty-six years of Rameses II’s long
reign (which is said to have lasted sixty-seven)
were peaceful, and says one author, “It became
his passion and his pride to found new cities, to
raise dykes, to dig canals, to build fortresses, to
multiply statues, obelisks and inscriptions, and to
erect the most costly temples in which man ever
worshipped.”</p>

<p>His eldest sons appear to have died before him,
or been passed over in the succession, for it was
his thirteenth son, Meremptah, who shared his
authority and eventually succeeded him. He is
believed to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus,
as Rameses II of the oppression of the Israelites.</p>

<p>In strange contrast to the life of Rameses II
was the disposition of his body after death; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
is a story told of the mummy of one of the
Pharaohs, that in order to obtain entrance into
Cairo, with his prize, Bruch Bey was obliged to
pay octroi duty on “dead fish,” as the officials
refused to admit it free of duty and the register
contained no directions as to mummies. Doubtless
Rameses II received magnificent burial, but
in later reigns many royal tombs were rifled and
his among them; the empty tomb now remains,
but only filled with rubbish, the body of the king,
with those of many others, being removed. Inscriptions
record that this occurred more than
once. In the sixteenth year of the reign of Pinotem
I it was placed in the tomb of Amenophis I,
so that even in death sometimes “uneasy lies the
head that wears a crown.” It is said that in 1880
his mummy was offered for sale to an American
gentleman, who, doubting its genuineness, refused
to purchase.</p>

<p>In 1881 the wonderful discovery of the shaft
containing so many royal mummies was made,
and their removal to the museum of Gizeh is
thus described, “Already it was known, far and
wide, that these kings and queens of ancient
times were being conveyed to Cairo, and for
more than fifty miles below Thebes the villages
turned out en masse, not merely to stare at the
piled decks, as the steamer went by, but to show
respect to the illustrious dead. Women, running
along the banks and shrieking the death
wail; men, ranged in solemn silence and firing
their guns in the air, greeted the Pharaohs as
they passed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>And so after change of burial place and even
of coffin, one of the most celebrated of human
monarchs lies in a museum, for the inspection of
every careless passerby; a strong commentary on
human greatness and human pride.</p>

<p>The mummy was unrolled, by Maspero, June,
1886, and was found to be five feet six inches in
length. The head was small and long; the hair,
apparently white at the time of death, was made
yellow with drugs; the forehead, low and narrow;
the eyebrows, arched and bushy; the eyes,
small and close to the thin-hooked nose; the
temples were hollow, the cheek bones prominent
and the ears wearing rings were round. The
expression he calls intelligent, but slightly sensual,
proud, obstinate and majestic, even in death.</p>

<p>And what of Queen Urmaa-nofrura? As the
bride alone, young and fair, she comes before us,
and we find no record of her further history, or
of her death. Was it in her power, as in that of
the fair Queen Esther of Scripture, to do aught
for the people of her native land or to influence
in any way for good the haughty sovereign to
whom she was allied? Perhaps, and perhaps
only.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_17">CHAPTER SEVENTEENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">TAUSERT.</span></h2>

<p>As Queen Urma-nofru-Ra may be considered
the bride of life, so we may call Queen Tausert
the bride of the tomb, since it is from her tomb
alone that we learn anything of her history, and
even there the information is most meagre. Her
name is mentioned as Ta-ursr, Tauser, Tausert
or Taosiri, and it makes her somewhat distinctive
among the various Neferts and Tis. She is
called “the great queen and the lady of the land,
the princess of Upper and Lower Egypt.”</p>

<p>She is noteworthy chiefly as being of the blood
royal and thus conferring dignity upon her husband,
Siptah, or Si-Ptah, her name taking precedence
of his on the monuments, as did that of
Queen Ti, wife of Seti I. Also she was the last
queen of the great Nineteenth Dynasty, of which
Seti I and Rameses II were such renounced monarchs,
and of whose queens Ti, Nofritari Mini-mut
and Urma-nofru-Ra we have already given
outline sketches. To this Dynasty, called Diospolites,
Lepsius gives the date beginning 1443
B. C., and Wilkinson 1340 B. C., and one division
makes it the Middle Empire.</p>

<p>The earliest Egyptian monarchs of whom we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
have any record built for themselves tombs which
seemed destined to last till eternity, the Pyramids,
which some one has finely described as
“stony tents where innumerable centuries have
encamped, which time in vain seeks to drive from
the field,” and which seem more like Druidical
remains than specimens of architecture.</p>

<p>Says Lady Duff Gordon, in her charming
“Letters:” “There is such a curious sight of a
crowd of men carrying huge blocks of stone up
out of a boat. One sees exactly how the stones
were carried in ancient times; they sway their
bodies all together like one great lithe animal,
with many legs, and hum a low chant to keep
time. It is quite unlike carrying heavy weights
in Europe.”</p>

<p>Later kings spent their energies differently.
They built palaces and temples and chose to be
buried in caverns in the natural rocks through
which they honeycombed innumerable passages,
hewed out great halls, or constructed pits in
which their mortal remains could be hidden from
the light of day.</p>

<p>Rameses II lived to a ripe old age, his wives
perhaps dying before him, as many of his children
certainly did. Of their lives we know
little, of their death nothing. The sacred books
say of one Pharaoh, perhaps of Rameses II, that
in heaven he will, at his pleasure, take wives
from their husbands, so idolatrous was the worship
accorded to these haughty, and often tyrannical
kings. Seti I had, as we have seen, in early
years united his son, Rameses, with himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the government of his kingdom, and Rameses II
adopted the same plan, making his thirteenth son,
Meremptah, co-ruler, with himself. In the government
of the kingdom. The elder sons, of
whom Khamus is known to have been an especial
favorite of his father (as was Bint-Antha among
the daughters), died before him, or there was
some other reason which prevented their following
in natural succession. The consensus of
opinion seems to be that Rameses II was the oppressor
of the Hebrews, and Meneptah the monarch
from whom they escaped.</p>

<p>The Israelites are believed to have toiled on
the temples, palaces and other architectural
works at Tanis, and on the treasure city of Paten
or Pithom. They are mentioned in a triumphal
inscription, found by Petrie, near the temple of
Medinet Aboo, opposite Thebes. It was engraved
on an old slab, originally polished, inscribed
and put in place in a temple, by Amen-hotep
III, which Meremptah, with the ruthlessness
of many of the kings, took and also inscribed
on the back, or rougher side, to glorify
himself. Part of it reads, “The Hittites are
quieted. Taken is Askelon. The Israelites are</p>

<p class="transnote">(Transcriber’s Note: A line (or more) seems to be missing here from the original.)</p>

<p class="noindent">tions, who had invaded Egypt. Petrie also found,
among the ruins of a funeral temple at Thebes, a
bust of this king, in grey granite, which has “a
firm and rather dogged expression, not untinged
with melancholy.” The wife of Meremptah is
given as Ast-Nefert or Isis Nefert, but of her
personal history we know nothing. The mummy
of a certain Queen Anhipu, said to belong to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Nineteenth Dynasty, was found, but no details of
her life.</p>

<p>Amenmesses “Mighty Bull, beloved of Maat,”
is, by some authorities, said to have usurped the
throne after Meremptah; his mother is given as
Taak Taakhat, “divine mother, royal mother,
great Lady,” and his wife as “royal spouse, the
great one, lady of the two lands.” He built a
tomb in the Valley of the Kings, and he, with his
mother and wife, are buried there. It has three
corridors and two chambers, and in one his
mother and in another his wife are making offerings
to the gods.</p>

<p>Another list commonly given is as follows,
Rameses II, then Meremptah, Seti II, his grandson,
and Siptah, his great-grandson, perhaps by
marriage. Reproductions of the pictures of Seti
II and Siptah are given in Petrie’s articles, in
Miss Edward’s “Pharaohs, Fellahs and Explorers,”
as well doubtless as in other places, and
she claims for each of them the distinctive features
of the Rammeside family, long heads, long
noses, long bodies and long legs. Photographs
have been taken of Siptah and others from the
bas-reliefs in the Valley of the Tombs of the
Kings, at Thebes. Ebers, in his romance of
“Joshua,” mentions Siptah as the nephew of
Meremptah and as intriguing to supplant him.</p>

<p>Queen Tausert’s husband is elsewhere spoken
of as Meremptah Siptah, the son of an usurper,
giving color to the idea that it was she and not
he who was the descendant of Rameses II.
Among ordinary people the tomb was often prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
for husband and wife together, and occasionally
the mummy of the first who died was kept
in the house till the death of the second, a constant
suggestion that they might soon be reunited,
and in pictures they are often betrayed with the
arm of one around the neck or waist of the other,
showing that affectionate relations were usual.
Death and the future life appear to have occupied
so large a share in the thoughts of the ancients
that their daily life was a sort of Appian Way,
lined with tombs, and we know much more of their
funerals than of their marriages and other
festivities.</p>

<p>The Egyptians were among the earliest, if not
the earliest nation to regard literature, to write
books (the inscribed papyrus roll being their
printed page, to be handed down to posterity)
and to preserve and value them.</p>

<p>The Book of the Dead, of which sections belonging
to different periods have been found, was
a sort of Bible, for which the Egyptians entertained
the most profound respect and whose maxims
they seem to have used, both as a guide in
life and in their preparation of the dead for the
tomb. The papyrus containing the tale of “The
Two Brothers,” in which the younger was unjustly
accused of wrongdoing towards his elder
brother’s wife, bears some resemblance to the
Bible story of Joseph’s experiences, and belongs
to the period of Seti II.</p>

<p>Diodorus speaks of a sacred library which he
said was inscribed “Dispensary of the Mind,”
and belonged to the period of Rameses III; some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
ruins believed to have been this building have
been found. There was a great hall and several
smaller rooms, supported by columns. “On the
jamb of one of the smaller rooms,” says Kendrick,
“was sculptured Thoth, the inventor of Letters,
and the goddess Saf, his companion, with the
title of ‘Lady of Letters and President of the Hall
of Books,’ accompanied, the former with an emblem
of the sense of sight, the latter with that
of hearing.”</p>

<p>Treaties with foreign nations were often inscribed,
like that of Rameses II and the father
of Queen Urma-nofrura, on tablets of silver or
other metal, while accounts, letters and more
trivial matters, were written on pottery, fragments
of which have come down to our own day.
In these times, or even earlier, the Greeks made
their way into Egypt, and through them, as well
as from the monuments, we have derived much
of our knowledge of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>A late writer on Egypt, Isaac Meyer, draws a
parallel between Christianity and the old Egyptian
religion, and advances a theory, more ingenious
than reliable, that Christ may have been
in Egypt later than in his infancy. The
“Book of the Dead,” said to be the great storehouse
of Egyptian theology, shows refined and
ethical ideas. Horus, the sun-god, the victorious
of the resurrection from the dead to eternal life,
is found chief among the deities there represented,
wearing the Osirian crown, and with an
endless serpent, symbolic of eternity. Chapters
of this book were found in isolated places, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
at different times, “a collection of preceptus and
maxims on the conduct of life.” Many had fragments
of the revered volume buried beside them
or engraved on scarabeii as ornaments and decorations.
In later times than those which we are
now considering the mummy of a young girl
was found, with part of Homer in her coffin,
having in life probably been devoted to his poetry.</p>

<p>Some archeologists and students see traces of
original monotheism in the religion of the Egyptians,
one central idea of deity perhaps under
many forms, but the idea is not supported by
general testimony. “Deities,” says one writer,
“were merged into one another, qualities of one
were attributed to another till the pantheon resembled
the shifting pictures of the kaleidoscope.”</p>

<p>Some of the Egyptian precepts and maxims are
not without their value in modern times, such as
“If thou humblest thyself in obeying a superior,
thy conduct is wholly good before God. Knowing
who ought to obey and who ought to command,
lift not thy heart against the latter.” And
again, “If thou desirest thy conduct to be good
and preserved from evil, keep thyself from attacks
of bad temper. It is wrong to fly in a passion
with one’s neighbor to the point of not knowing
how to manage one’s words.”</p>

<p>Siptah is sometimes spoken of as an anti-king,
regarded as an usurper, rather than a rightful
heir, and his name is occasionally omitted from
the list of kings. His Horus name is said to
mean Horus rising in Khebit; he added nothing
important to the temples and, though depicted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
relief in Silsila and other places, it is probably
only commemorative of small repairs. Buried in
his wife’s tomb, he was removed, in the troublous
times of the Twentieth Dynasty, to the tomb of
Amenhetep II. The original tomb has three or
four corridors and several chambers. A picture
of the queen, offering gifts to the gods, was plastered
over by Sek-nebta, who usurped the tomb.
The remains of the funeral temple of the king
and queen were excavated by Professor Petrie in
1896. Her temple was between those of Meren-Ptah
and Thothmes IV, and his north of the
temple of Amenhetep II.</p>

<p>Another suggestion as regards Siptah is that
he may have ruled over one part of Egypt—the
rightful king over another. But, whatever the
ambiguity of his earlier history, it is known that
he was buried with his wife in the Valley of the
Tombs of the Kings, Queen Tausert taking her
place with her husband, and not among the
Tombs of the Queens where so many of the
royal ladies were laid.</p>

<p>There were probably revolutions and counter
revolutions, till the reins of government were once
more finally in the hands of Rameses III.
Whether from the ambition of an usurper to be
laid with the true line of kings, or from a deep
affection, Siptah and Tausert shared their tomb,
the queen probably having died first, and the king
subsequently, no doubt by special order being laid
beside her. The tomb was elaborately painted
and inscribed, but much is faded by time and the
light and air admitted by explorers. Champoleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
believed, we are told, that he had discovered a cartouch
of Seti-Nekht, engraved above that of Seti
II, and the latter above that of Tausert and Siptah;
but “there is no visible trace of this superposition
which would assign to Siptah a date anterior
to Seti II.”</p>

<p>One writer says of Tausert that who the queen
was is unknown; she may have been a queen
dowager, with special rights as daughter of
a Pharaoh, and may have been the widow of
Seti I and mother of the Prince of Cush, if so
Siptah was her husband’s brother and child’s
uncle. She is also spoken of as “hereditary
daughter—exalted.”</p>

<p>Belzone made a close investigation of these
tombs, discovering various points of interest
which had escaped the notice of earlier explorers.
The tombs were cut in the face of the limestone
rock, with passages, steps and doorways, and a
pit at the end, probably to discourage intruders.
He broke through a wall which gave a hollow
sound when struck, and discovered several more
pillared halls and passages. The body, which,
by embalming, was converted into a mummy, was,
especially in the case of royalty and other distinguished
people, most carefully preserved. First
placed in a casket of cedar or other wood elaborately
painted with figures of the gods, this again
in an outer casket of wood, more roughly decorated,
and finally in a stone sarcophagus.</p>

<p>Reference has been made before to a sort of
court or trial which was held at the entrance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the grave to decide if the deceased was worthy
to enter the presence of Osiris.</p>

<p>In a modern Arab funeral a number of men
walk first, chanting a ritual. The bier, with a
high peak in front, like the prow of a Nile boat,
is carried by friends and comes next, and upon
the bier a tin horn is placed if the corpse is a
man, a shawl and jewelry and other ornaments,
if a woman, and a red shawl indicates youth. A
more minute description of this is given by Pollard,
in the “Land of the Monuments.” The funerals
take place within a few hours of death. Different
from the old Egyptian custom, the body
in its winding sheet is covered with shawls, and
the procession is closed by the chief mourners,
followed by friends, sometimes walking hand in
hand.</p>

<p>Details as regards the tomb of Tausert and
Siptah are to be found in the guide books, but
the passing traveller will probably glance hastily
at pictures and inscriptions and hurry on; only
the student has leisure or inclination for minute
or accurate investigation. The tomb represents
the royal couple absorbed in religious exercises,
offering to the various gods and goddesses their
prayers, praises and gifts. The queen stands before
Harmachus, “god of the morning,” and Anubis,
“the god of the dead,” and Ne-fer-tum-Hor,
and again before Ptah, “the Opener,” and Ma,
“goddess of Truth.” All representations of this
last goddess are said to be “refined, calm and
peaceful” in expression and worthy of the character
of the goddess of Truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the king stands before Isis, “the mother,”
and Horns, “the son,” and in other pictures the
royal consorts are together before some god, perhaps
carrying or crowned with flowers. And
again the queen before Harmachus, Hathor, the
Egyptian Venus, and Nepthys, “lady of the
house.” The sarcophagus of Tausert bears her
likeness, between Isis and Nepthys, a conventional
idea of what a goddess was or should be, setting
the pattern.</p>

<p>The tomb has also other pictures of some of the
lesser gods, armed with knives, keeping guard
over a chapel, to ward off evil ones, Hathor standing
in the doorway. Again the king and the high
priest, sacrificing to Osiris and the winged goddess
Ma in the doorway of a chapel, signifying
that only Truth may enter. Here is what is
called the act of opening the mouth of the royal
likeness in the Hall of Gold. The high priest
appears with his staff and panther skin, the Kereb
and lower priests, who take part in the ceremony,
and the people as “those who come to the tomb,”
offering incense. Various rooms are carved and
ornamented with pictures of numerous gods,
Thoth with the moon upon his head, Ma with
outspread wings, serpents, boats and other
symbols.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevenson, who has made an especial
study of Egyptian symbols, says that most of the
Egyptian goddesses may be said, broadly speaking,
to represent either luminous space, or the
activity of the god with whom they are associated,
and their common attributes make it easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
for the Egyptians to reduce them to one type.
Sekhet, “the striker”; Neith, who “shoots”; Hat-Hor,
meaning “the home of Horus,” the mother
of Horus; one of those designations is “the
mighty striker,” son of Hat-Hor, and who, at
Dendereh, where she was especially worshipped
as the “holy one,” is expressly called Sekhet-Neith,
while all are called “Eye of Ra.” “There
are,” she continues, “exceptions, such as Maut,
who represents abstract truth and justice, Safekh,
etc.; and in certain localities where the goddess
stood alone, like Neith at Sais, she included all
the attributes of divinity, but her place in the
local triad is as indicated above.”</p>

<p>But to return to the tomb. One hall with seats
seems to suggest that another sarcophagus rested
there. So we spell out, read and speculate over
these monuments of long ago. This king and
queen were doubtless buried with great honors;
which was it, love or ambition, that ruled their
lives and stamped with its signet even their tomb?
Could it be said of them that “they were lovely
in their lives and in death they were not divided”?
Evidently they did not wish to accept the
common lot of man, to pass away and be forgotten.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_18">CHAPTER EIGHTEENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">SUCCEEDING QUEENS.</span></h2>

<p>From the time of Rameses II to that of the
Ptolemy period no queen seems to make a marked
impression on the passing centuries. We have
here and there a name, here and there an anecdote;
but no figure, with salient points, stands
out, about which cluster vitalizing incidents, or
upon whom we may drape a robe of woven romance.
Nor were there many, even among the
kings, who have the bold outlines of some of
their predecessors.</p>

<p>Seck-net or Seti-nekht was first of the Twentieth
Dynasty, is believed to have reigned seven
years, and united with himself, and was succeeded
by, his son Rameses III. He seems to
have made no special mark upon his time, was
neither a great ruler nor a great builder, and we
know little of him. There is a picture of him
and Rameses III kneeling on either side of the
sun’s disk, and he appropriated and enlarged the
tomb of Queen Tausert for himself, covering the
figures and name of the queen with stucco.</p>

<p>Rameses III was a builder of temples, a rich,
magnificent and splendor-loving monarch, a warrior
and conqueror. His Hobrus names were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
“Mighty bull, great one of kings,” and “Mighty
bull, beloved of Maat, establisher of the lands.”
But, even at a period, whose moral point of view
was so different from the Christian, it is claimed
that this was a court distinguished for its licentiousness.
His queen’s name is given as Ast, or Ise,
also as Hemalczotha, which seems to suggest that
she was a foreigner, possibly a Khitan or Assyrian
princess. Her father is spoken of as Hebuansozanath.
Often the space beside the king’s name is left
vacant, as if she could not or would not appear
in his company. From her tomb also her name is
obliterated, while that of her husband and son
remain.</p>

<p>The walls of the temples and palaces built by
Rameses III are adorned with the story of his
life. There are naval engagements, the ships
with embroidered sails, and the king is seen as
a conqueror, of the Libyans and others, carried
in state above the heads of the people, surrounded
by priests and followed by warriors and captives,
while in other processions the queen also
appears, following. The great Harris papyrus,
too, of the thirty-second year of his reign, found
near the temple of Medinet-Abou or Haboo, gives
much information concerning him and a long list
of gifts which he presented to the temples.</p>

<p>Among the other pictures on the walls we see
Rameses III enjoying himself in the midst of, some
say his daughters, but more probably the members
or slaves of his harem. Others, again, believe
them to be intended for goddesses or mythological
characters. Sylph-like figures attend upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the king. To quote from a previous article upon
the subject, “One plays draughts with him, another
holds a lotus blossom to his nose (a favorite
attention in Egypt), others offer him wine and
refreshments. The queen, as a chief figure, nowhere
appears. The costumes approach that of
the Garden of Eden, a necklace and light sandals.
We are reminded of the description of a Japanese
family: ‘The summer costume of a middle
class Japanese consists of a queue, a breechcloth
and a pair of sandals; that of his son and heir
the same minus the queue, the cloth and the sandals,
while that of his spouse is a little, and only
a little more elaborate.’”</p>

<p>It is impossible, naively and gravely, remarks
one critic, rather than from the standpoint
of the Twentieth Century, than the Twentieth Dynasty,
that respectable families should so
have conducted themselves, therefore the garments
must have evaporated in the course of
years. But it was so near the Garden of Eden,
the climate was so warm, and the little creatures
seem so at ease in their airy nothings, that it is almost
appears as if “beauty unadorned was
adorned the most.” Some of the pictures are too
obscene for reproduction.</p>

<p>It is of interest to note how very ancient are
certain games, such as chess, draughts or checkers,
and others which still hold a place among
our modern amusements. Other pictures, discovered
years ago in the mastabas or grave chambers,
of still earlier date, 5200 B. C., give also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
game of chess, the invention of which has been
attributed both to India and China.</p>

<p>Extensive insurrection and disturbances, it is
evident, had prevailed in the kingdom, and that
Rameses III had brought order out of the chaos.
He described himself as “the darling of Amen,
the victory-bringing Horus.” After his conquests
he turned his attention to building, commerce,
digging of reservoirs and planting of trees; nevertheless
a general decline of Egypt is said to have
begun in his reign.</p>

<p>But if the king had restored order in the land,
not so well had he kept his own household in
check. Records remain of a conspiracy which
arose in his harem, headed by the Lady Ti, Thi,
or Tey, said to be the mother of a certain Pentaur
or Pen-ta-urt, whom she wished to put upon
the throne. She probably hated the “royal wife,
the great lady, the lady of two lands, Ast.” In
exactly what way the Lady Ti was related to the
king is not specified. In both the museums of
Paris and Turin there is some account of this
<i lang="fr">cause celebre</i>. The steward, Pal-bak-Amen, was
her chief co-adjutor, also a certain Penhuiban or
Hui, a cattle inspector, who indulged in “Black
Art,” made amulets and images of wax for ladies,
and had books containing directions how to strike
people blind and to make figures in effigy to bring
trouble upon any one who was hated. Melting
wax figures and sticking pins in them to harm an
enemy we think of as belonging to the age of
Queen Elizabeth, and lo, it was known and practiced
in Egypt thousands of years before!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, may it not have been also
possible that Queen Ise or Ast had some share
in the plot, or at least sympathized with it, thus
giving another reason for the non-appearance of
her name beside the king’s. One of the ladies
concerned wrote to her brother, commanding the
army in Ethiopia, and ordered or entreated him
to fight against the king. But whether he did as
was desired or not, the revolt was unsuccessful.
It was crushed with some severity, and it is said
forty men and six women were compelled to commit
suicide, and a mummy, thought to be that
of Pentaur, and showing signs of death by poison,
has been found.</p>

<p>Rameses III reigned thirty-seven years, and
there is a list of his sons, several of whom succeeded
him. He was buried in the Tombs of
the Kings, doubtless with all the honors of state,
but his body was not allowed to rest in peace,
it was included in the general upheaval caused
by robbers, before described. His mummy was
found in the large coffin of Nefertari-Aames, and
on being unrolled fell to dust. His features were
said to be softer, finer and more intelligent than
some of his predecessors, his figure less straight
and vigorous and his shoulders narrower. His
red granite sarcophagus is in the Louvre and the
lid in the Fitz-William museum at Cambridge.
His tomb is sometimes called “the Harpers,” from
the figure of two harpers in a scene on one side,
also “Bruce’s tomb” from the name of the modern
discoverer. Among the treasures found in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
tomb were two golden baskets. His period is
given as 1200 B. C.</p>

<p>Rameses III was succeeded by his sons or connections
of the same name, who followed him,
as one writer has said, with “ominous rapidity,”
from number one to number thirteen. They seem
to have been a faineant race, and the proud name
of Rameses degenerated from reign to reign.
Here and there in the Tombs of the Kings, or
in other spots, we find their last resting places.</p>

<p>Among them, perhaps, Rameses IV was one of
the most conspicuous; and his queen, given as
Isis-Ast, was buried in the Tombs of the Queens.
The tombs of Rameses IV and VI are decorated
with astronomical designs; the sun appears in
his chariot as Horus-Ra, and that of Rameses
IV has pictures of the resurrection. The seventh
son is given as Ramessu Meritum, son of Queen
Muf-nofer-ari.</p>

<p>A papyrus of the time of Rameses IX gives
an account of the violation of the royal tombs
by robbers, which was then discovered; and this
Abbott papyrus contains a list of the tombs inspected,
hence the mummies were removed at different
periods from place to place for greater
safety. A woman called “Little Cat” confessed
that she had been in the tomb of Queen Ast, wife
of Rameses III, and purloined various articles.</p>

<p>The line of priest-kings, of whom Her-Hor was
the first, chose a common place of sepulture, and
thither were at last carried many of the earlier
royal remains. The discovery of these in the
cave at Deir-el-Bahari made a world-wide sensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and has already been referred to. There
were three kings of the Thothmes name, two
Rameses and Seti I, as well as the later kings
of the priestly line, Pinotem or Pinozem I and II.</p>

<p>Here, too, we learn the little we know of some
of the queens. There was Queen Ansera, of the
Seventeenth Dynasty, Queen Aames Nofritari,
Hatimoohoo, and Sitha of the Eighteenth, and
queens Notem-Maut, Hathor-Houtta-ni, Ma-ka-Ra,
and Isem-Kheb, and a queen Hest-em-Seket,
as well as Princess Nesi-Khonsu, and a number
of princesses and priestesses, called “Singers of
Amen.”</p>

<p>Some of the coffins of this period show, on a
yellow ground, a picture of the dead piercing a
serpent with a lance. Among the Tombs of the
Queens are a few of the Eighteenth, but more
of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties. Here
was placed the wife of Rameses III, with name
no longer legible. Here Queen Ti, or Titi, wife
of the earlier King Amenophis III, with her blue
eyes and fair skin, pictured as making offerings
to the gods. Here Bint-Antha, favorite daughter
of Rameses II. One tomb has the name obliterated
and Tuattent-apt written upon it in red ink.
Here is Isis-Ast, wife of Rameses IV, Queen Sitra
of the Twentieth Dynasty, and many others.</p>

<p>There is an interesting story of a queen, by
some authorities said to be the wife of Rameses
XIII, by others of Rameses XII, and by some
queen of Rameses II or III, claiming that Rameses
XII was never in Mesopotamia, while Mariette
believes it to have been merely a legend invented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
by the priests to do honor to the god
Chonsu or Khonsu. This king, whatever his
place in the royal line, was, like his great predecessor,
Amenophis III, fond of hunting. He
also went abroad to collect tribute from subjugated
peoples, and in Mesopotamia among those
who came to pay was a certain chief or prince,
who brought with him a beautiful daughter, with
whom the Egyptian king at once fell in love and
bore her home to share his life and throne. This
princess of Bakhten took the name of Ra-neferu,
“the glories of the sun,” and evidently had much
influence with her husband. For later came messengers
from her native country, saying that her
sister, Bentresh, was ill, and begging for the loan
of the ark of the god Khonsu, which was sure
to cure her. We can hardly imagine the king
willing to part with such a treasure, except to
pleasure the queen. To her wishes, therefore, he
yielded, and the ark, with a proper escort, was
sent away, and accomplished a miraculous cure,
as had been anticipated. Naturally, those who
were benefited clung to the same, and years
passed without the return of the borrowed treasure.
But finally the king, or prince, of Bakhtan,
“dreamed a dream,” like the Pharaoh of Scriptures,
in which a golden hawk came out of the
ark and flew to Egypt. Possibly the king of
Egypt had demanded its return before, or perhaps
the queen’s influence had been used to induce
him to leave it, for the benefit of her family,
as long as possible. The explanation is not
given, but at last the conscience of the delinquent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
was pricked, and the ark, with royal honors, was
returned to its native land.</p>

<p>Queen Ra-neferu is variously spoken of as
Mesopotamian, Bakhtan or Lidyan. From this
story we may infer that she was young and beautiful
at the period of her marriage, that she had
great influence with the king, and possessed near
relatives to whom she was warmly attached. But
this, so far as we know it, is the whole of her
history, and other queens than she of this same
general period make no figure among the records.</p>

<p>For some time the priests had been gaining
in power and influence, and Rameses XIII seems
to have been set aside and Her-Hor, priest of
Amen, the third who had directed affairs of state,
seized the reins of government. He is described
as of a “pleasing countenance,” with features that
were delicate and good, and expression that
was mild and agreeable. The priest-kings
were the chief rulers, but a few descendants of
previous Pharaohs held sway in a portion of the
kingdom, as Japan was once divided between the
Mikado of the old regime and the Shogun, the
military and political chief.</p>

<p>Of these monarchs and such of their consorts
as are mentioned we now give a brief summary,
chiefly following the guidance of the well known
Egyptologist, Professor Wallis Budge.</p>

<p>Nes-ba-Tettet is called the first king of the
Twenty-first Dynasty of Tanis. From the time
of this king to that of Rsammetichus II, third
king of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, the dates are
given as from about 1100 to 600 B. C. Egypt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
declined in power and influence, and its tributaries
recovered their independence. With the
close of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty the New Empire
came to an end, and the period of Egyptian
Renaissance began. The feeble kingdoms
of the South and North were again united, under
Shashang I, and a Libyan reigned. The worship
of the cat-headed goddess Bast increased, and that
of Amen-Ra declined, while his priests were
forced to seek refuge in Napata, Nubia. Esarhaddon,
king of Asyria, sacked Thebes, and ruled
by governors.</p>

<p>Nes-ba-Tettet, the Smendes of Manetho, possibly
a descendant of Rameses II, reigned at
Tanis, while the priest king Her-Hor reigned at
Thebes. The name of the former’s queen, Thent-Amen,
is about all we know of her, and is thought
to suggest her having the true claim to the
throne. King Nes-ba-Tettet reigned twenty-nine
years, making no such mark in history as did his
great predecessors. This king is also called
Nessu Ba-neb-Tet.</p>

<p>Next came Pasebkhanut I, second of the Tanite
kings, who was called the “Mighty Bull,” and
reigned forty-one years. The statues of the Nile,
North and South, in the Cairo Museum, are said
to belong to this period.</p>

<p>Long and uneventful seem to have been the
reigns of these kings, for Amen-em-apt, “Amen
in Karnak,” a descendant of Nes-ba-Tettet,
reigned forty-nine years, and our chief knowledge
of him seems to be derived from a stele at Cairo,
making offerings to Isis, his favorite goddess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Possibly this king was succeeded by one or
two others, with short reigns. Authorities do not
seem decided on this point. A king, Sa-Sa-Amen,
is believed to have reigned sixteen years; his
greatest work was the restoration of the pylons
of the temple of Rameses III at Tanis. Gold
and porcelain tablets have also been found, engraved
with his name, and he added it also to the
two obelisks taken from Heliopolis to Alexandria,
and thence in modern times to London and New
York, thereby proving he had authority in Heliopolis.</p>

<p>Pasebkhanut II added Heru to his name, thus
distinguishing himself from Pasebkhanut I. He
was the last king of the Tanite, Twenty-first
Dynasty, and his daughter is said to have married
Solomon. We read in I Kings: “And Solomon
made affinity with Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and
took Pharaoh’s daughter and brought her into
the city of David.” Thus, in the so usual fashion,
he strengthened his political connection by marriage.
And the Bible further says: “Pharaoh,
king of Egypt, had gone up and taken Gezer and
burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that
dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto
his daughter, Solomon’s wife.” Pasebkhanut II
reigned, it is said, twelve years, and another
daughter married Osorkon I, the first king of
the Twenty-second Dynasty.</p>

<p>We now turn again to the priest-kings in
Thebes, also called the Twenty-first Dynasty. Of
the first of them, Her-Heru, or Her-Hor, we have
already spoken. A common title of his was “Living,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
beautiful god, son of Amen, lord of the two
lands, lord of diadems,” and he wore the royal
uraeus on his forehead. Queen Notem-Mut, Notimit,
or Netchemet, was either mother or wife
of King Her-Hor—authorities differ as to which
relation she held to him. By some she was believed
to be a princess of Rammeside blood, as
her name is found encircled by a royal cartouch,
while that of the king was not so decorated until
the fifth year of his reign. Another says she
was called “great royal consort,” but not king’s
daughter or princess. There is a finely executed
but dilapidated statue of this queen, inlaid with
glass, and her head is also on a sphinx. A papyrus
belonging to her, illustrated with medallion
heads, or portrait vignettes of her husband, or
son, Her-Hor, still exists, part being in the
Louvre, part in the British Museum, and part in
the possession of a lady in Berlin. It was the
sale of some of these fragments that led to the
discovery of the royal mummies at Deir-el-Bahari.
The canopic boxes of Queen Notem-Mut represented,
according to custom, a little chapel, placed
on a sledge, a small jackal in black wood, mounted
on the cover. Many were found, like the mummies
themselves, in coffins not belonging to them,
but their inscriptions tell who were the rightful
owners. Miss Edwards discovers a likeness between
one of the carved masks of Rameses II
and the vignettes of Her-Hor, and thinks the
mummy case may have been made in the time
of the Twenty-first Dynasty and given the likeness
of the reigning king, rather than the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
for whom it was intended. Her-Hor repaired
and preserved many of the mummies of
the more ancient kings.</p>

<p>He was succeeded, apparently, not by his son
Piankhi, or Pianchi (who perhaps died before
him or whose reign was too short or insignificant
to be dwelt upon), but by his grandson, Pinotem,
Pinozem, or Pai-netchem I, who is said to have
married a princess of the old line, a daughter of
Pa-seb-kha-nut I, king of Tanis, and who is variously
termed Maat-ka-Ra, Ra-ma-ka, or Rahama.
He was both high priest and king, which has
caused some confusion to the chronologists. His
Horus name was “he who satisfieth the gods, he
who performeth glorious things for their
doubles.” He had a long reign, some say twenty-one
years. Queen Maat-ka-Ra is called on one
of her coffins, “divine wife, a priestess of Amen,
in the Apts, lady of the two lands.” In the
same coffin was the tiny mummy of her infant
daughter, Mutem-hat. Mother and child evidently
died soon after the birth of the latter.
A box with two compartments accompanied
them, filled with funeral statuettes for the two
queens, for the baby, though she died and was
embalmed in infancy, is called Queen Maut-em-hat.
An accompanying papyrus gives the royal
cartouch, around the name of Maat-ka-Ra, but
to the child also, strangely enough, the title of
“Royal Wife,” etc. Another wife of the same
king was called Henttaui, daughter of Nebseni,
and Thent-Amen, and mother of the high priest
of Amen, Men-keper-Ra. Her mummy, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
double coffin, was found at Deir-el-Bahari. Great
efforts had been made to preserve the lifelike
aspect, red was put on the lips and cheeks, and
the eyes were treated with eye-paint. She wore
a much becurled wig, and even the furrows made
by mummification were filled with paste. Pai-netchem
I had also been removed to Deir-el-Bahari,
and the upper part of the body was
found rifled of amulets, but the lower part was
intact, the Book of the Dead between the legs.
He had repaired and found places of safety for
royal mummies, Amen-hetep II, Thothmes II,
Rameses II and Rameses III.</p>

<p>The priest kings made Thebes their residence
while the old line dwelt at Tanis or San. One
writer says that the papyri of the princes and
princesses of the family of Pai-netchem or Pi-nozem
show the best traditions of art to have been
yet in force in the time of the Twenty-first Dynasty.
The ushabti, little figures which so often
were placed in the tombs with the mummies,
came into general use in the Eighteenth Dynasty.
They were made of painted limestone, hard
stone, steatite, wood, etc. At the end of the dynasty
they began to be made of porcelain, and
were glazed with such colors as mauve, yellow,
chocolate and blue. In the Nineteenth Dynasty
blue was the universal color, and figures were
made like living people, in every-day clothes,
rather than, as previously, to resemble mummies.
This continued through the Twentieth Dynasty
and is found sporadically under the Twenty-second,
while in the Twenty-first, as a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
rule, they had returned to the mummy form and
had a brilliant blue glaze with black inscriptions.
In the “Book of the Dead,” in the Eighteenth
Dynasty, the vignettes were sometimes colored,
sometimes plain, later coarser and more representative
of modern things.</p>

<p>Masaherth and Men-kheper-Ra, sons of Pai-netchem
I, seem to have been priests rather than
kings. The latter married Ast-em-khebit, and
became the father of Pai-netchem II, Hent-taui,
and others. Ast-em-khebit or Ist-em-khebit is
sometimes spoken of as queen, and probably belonged
to the royal line. Authorities differ much
as to this period, and it is difficult to give a
perfectly clear account of the succession. Many
of this lady’s belongings were found among
those of the royal mummies so often referred to.
That she died before her husband is proved by
his seals remaining unbroken upon the hamper
of mummified food accompanying the body. She
was evidently much beloved, and buried, like
others of her family, with special care, in three
coffins, elaborately decorated and swathed in the
finest of linen, in long plaits. The usual shabti,
or “little servants,” accompanied her, as well as
beautiful vases in blue glass, inscribed with funerary
legends. Baskets of food, boxes with wigs,
and many other articles, the reproductions of
those used in daily life, were included in her
burial outfit. A pet gazelle was also mummified
and buried with her, a pathetic suggestion of
her tenderness of heart. While crumbled and
cast aside was her funeral tent, with an inscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
wishing her “a happy repose,” among the
first articles found when the modern discoverers
entered these long hidden places of sepulture.</p>

<p>Pai-netchem II, son of Ast-em-Khebit, married
Nes-su-Khensu, who seems sometimes to be regarded
as a queen, and is the last of the line of
whom we have record. Her husband, too, appears
rather as a high priest and commander of soldiers
than a king, and again the claim to higher descent
may have been on the lady’s side. There were
several children of this marriage, but they are
not specially noteworthy.</p>

<p>The priests apparently did little for the enlargement
or aggrandizement of Egypt. They
ruled about a hundred and twenty-five years, preserved
generally friendly relations with the more
ancient royal line, seem to have been less oppressive
and despotic than some of the earlier
kings, and contented themselves with repairing
the temples and the royal mummies, and have left
behind many interesting funeral remains and
papyri, said to form a highly important class of
literature.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_19">CHAPTER NINETEENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">SUCCEEDING QUEENS (CONTINUED).</span></h2>

<p>Authorities agree that the Twenty-second Dynasty
made Bubastis its principal city, and seem
to have been descended from a race of great
chiefs. Shashanq or Sheshenk I, the Sesonchis
of the Greeks, and Shishak of I Kings, was
the first king of the dynasty, a Libyan, son of
the chief Namareth, who was buried at Abydos,
and of whom there are statues in Florence, as
well as gold bracelets with his name in the British
Museum. Also the grandson of Shashanq,
the “great prince of Mashauasha,” and the Egyptian
princess, Mehtet-en-usekht. Shashanq I
married a Rammeside princess, and through her,
probably, or possibly through his Egyptian grandmother,
laid claim to the throne. His reign seems
to have begun before the death of Paseb-khanut
II, last king of the Twenty-first, Tanite Dynasty.
One author says his wife’s rank was shown by
the prefix Sutem-sat, or others claim that this belonged
to the Egyptian grandmother.</p>

<p>Shashanq I married Karama, or Karamat,
called “a morning star of Amen,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
daughter of the last Tanite king. She
had been despoiled of her inheritance and
was restored to all her rights by this marriage.
The custom of taking more than one wife
often enables the student to reconcile apparent
discrepancies.</p>

<p>Brugsch says the ordinance relating to this
marriage was engraved on the north side of a
pylon, near the temple of Amon in Karnak. “Thus
spake Amon, the king of the gods,” “with regard
to any object of any kind, which Karamat, the
daughter of the king of Upper Egypt, Miamun
Pisebkhan, has brought with her as the hereditary
possession which had descended to her in
the Southern district of the country, and with
regard to each object of any kind whatever which
the people of the land have presented to her,
which they have at any time taken from the
(royal) lady, we hereby restore it to her. Any object
of any kind. Any object of any kind whatsoever
(which) belongs (as an inheritance to the
children) that (we hereby restore) to her children
for all time. Thus speaks Amon-Ra, the
king of the gods, the great king of the beginning
of all being, Mut, Khonsu and the great gods,”
etc., etc., at great length and with much repetition,
closing with a number of threats, if this command
is not complied with, and ending with “we
will sink their noses in the earth,” and an unfinished,
“we will.”</p>

<p>Josephus says that Jeraboam, the son of
Nebat, who revolted against Solomon, took refuge
with Shashanq I, until Solomon’s death, and married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
a daughter of the king of Egypt. Later Shashanq
I made an expedition against Rehoboam,
son of Solomon, who governed the two tribes, and
was proud of the victory by which he recovered
the Egyptian hold on Palestine. The dates of
the Twenty-second Dynasty are given by Budge
as 966 to 750 B. C. Shashanq I also repaired
the temples and caused his son, the viceroy of a
part of Egypt, to remove to a place of greater
safety various royal mummies, who perhaps travelled
more after death than during life. Shashanq
reigned twenty-one years, called himself
“Prince, doubly mighty, subduer of the nine
Bows, greatest of the mighty ones of all lands,”
thus falling not a whit behind his Rammeside
predecessors in his estimate of himself.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his son Osorkon, or Usarkon
I, who, according to Manetho, reigned fifteen
years. There is a head of Osorkon in the British
Museum, of a Mongolian type, once thought
to be one of the Hyksos kings. He appears to
have had two wives, Ta-shet-Kensu, whose son
Thekeleth succeeded to the throne, and Maat-Ka-Ra,
daughter of a Tanite king, whose son Shashanq
became high priest and commander of the
forces. He is, by some, credited with a third
wife, but she was perhaps merely a concubine,
and the two others evidently occupy a first place.</p>

<p>Takelut or The-keleth I followed, with a wife
named Shepes, daughter of Neter-mer-Heru,
probably a priest, or one of the Egyptian nobles,
and they had two sons; the eldest, Namareth became
a priest, while a second, Osorkon, succeeded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Manetho says Thekeleth I reigned twenty-three
years, but there are few authentic records remaining
either of him or his queens.</p>

<p>Usarkon or Osorkon II had three wives, and
according to the same authority reigned twenty-nine
years. One queen’s name was Karama, or
Kareama, and she had a son called Shashanq, a
name which seems frequently handed down in this
race. A second queen, Mat-ketch-ankh-s, or, as
she is elsewhere called, Mut-hat-ankhes, whose
son Namareth was again high priest, and a third,
Ast-em-khebit, daughter of the princess Thes-bast-peru,
who gave to her daughter her mother’s
name. During the reign of these sovereigns the
goddess Bast, who had formerly been a mere local
deity, rose to first importance, and Bubastis superseded
Memphis and Thebes as the principal city.
The king held magnificent festivals in honor of
Amen and as a tribute of respect to the queen,
who not only inherited sovereign rights over the
principality of Thebes, but was also high priestess
of Amen. Pontifical rights were sometimes inherited
in the female line, and this gave her husband
claims at Thebes, Bubastis being the chief
seat of his government.</p>

<p>A colossal Hathor-headed capitol, in the museum
in Boston, bears this inscription: “In the
year 22, in the first day of Choriak (October 8th
of our reckoning) the appearing of his majesty
in the Hall of Festival. He reposes on the throne,
and the consecration is begun, the consecration
of the harem of the house of Amon” (the priestesses
of Amon were designated as the wives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the god) “and the consecration of all the women
who have dwelt as priestesses therein since the
day of his fathers.”</p>

<p>There is a bas-relief showing a procession, first
the king, then the queen and her daughters, followed
by many priests and women, these last
slender and graceful, carrying water jars, said to
be of electrum, others bearing sheafs of flowers,
some the ankh or life sign, and still others in
single file, clapping their hands in measured time.</p>

<p>Queen Karama is followed by her or the king’s
daughters, and little dwarfs, like the god Bes, are
also included in the procession. The princesses
are called Tasbakeper, Karoma and Meri-Amen.
The queen assists the king in making offerings
in the great festival hall, built especially for the
purpose. A sculptured bas-relief of King Osorkon
II and Queen Karama, at full length, is in
the British Museum. Scarabs of these and later
periods are in the New York Museum and in
many other places. An inscription remains telling
of a great flood which occurred in this reign,
so that in order to enter the temples the priests
had to wade through water several feet deep,
and it is said to have been the highest rise of the
Nile ever known.</p>

<p>Of Shashanq II, who succeeded, or of his wife,
almost nothing is recorded; he was probably a
peaceful king and did little towards building or
repairing temples.</p>

<p>Queen Karemama was the wife of the next
king, Takelut or Theke-leth II, who reigned fifteen
years, and is described as the “Great chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of Mashanasha”; the queen is called “great royal
wife” and “beloved of Mut.” Brugsch speaks
of her as a daughter of Nimrod, and gives her
a very lengthy name, which we can only hope
that the lady was of sufficient size to carry. Another
wife is called Mut-em-hat-sat-Amen. The
former was the mother of the high priest Uarsarken.
The queen was descended from one of the
royal families of Thebes, and, perhaps in deference
to her wishes, they dwelt for a while
in Thebes, with a view also, no doubt, of propitiating
the priests. The queen is also called
“princess, great lady and mistress of the South.”</p>

<p>Shashanq III turned the huge statue of Rameses
II into a pylon, having no more respect for
his predecessors than did Rameses II himself, and
his exploits are inscribed and described after
those of Rameses II and Seti I. He adopted
the pre-nomen of Rameses II. An Apis bull, a
tablet records, was born in the twenty-eighth year
of his reign; but, though it lasted fifty-two years,
there seem to be no memorials remaining, which
was also the case with his successor, Pamai. Nor
in the reign of his son Shashanq or Shishak IV
do we find mention of the queen. The former
seems to have reigned only two, the latter thirty-seven
years.</p>

<p>All this time Egypt was in more or less of a
turmoil, with a divided or disputed succession,
“Such a condition of things,” says one writer,
“was of course fatal to literature and art,” which
latter “did not so much decline as disappear,” and
after Shashanq I no monarch of the line left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
any building or sculpture of the slightest importance.
In this period of doubt and disorder we
have the names of a king, Peta-Bast, Auuth-meri-Amen
and Uasar-ken or Osorkon III, whose
mother and wife are probably mentioned as “Royal
mother, royal wife, Tata-Bast, and son of the
sun, Nasaek (en) living forever” in a golden
aegis of the goddess Sekhet, in the Louvre.</p>

<p>Named as one of the Twenty-third Dynasty, we
have Pi-ankhi, who descended on Egypt from
Ethiopia, whither the priests had retired, who
made his capital at Napata and who, probably
through his wife was connected with the old
royal families of Egypt. Pi-ankhi called himself
“King of Kush,” and the mother, sister and
daughter of the king bore each a title of honor
as “Queen of Kush.” In inscriptions the king
is spoken of as being “like a panther,” and we
further read that “Then Nimrod sent forth his
wife, the queen and daughter of a king, Nes-thent-nes,”
or, as she elsewhere is called, Nes-thent-meh
to supplicate the queens and royal
king’s daughters and sisters. And they threw
themselves prostrate in the women’s house before
the queens (saying), “Pray come to me, ye
queens, king’s daughters and king’s sisters! Appease
Horus, the ruler of the palace. Exalted
is his person, great his triumphs. Cause his anger
to be appeased before my (prayer), else he
will give over to death the king, my husband (but)
he is brought low”; when they had finished her
majesty was moved in her heart at the supplication
of the queen. This comes from a closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
written memorial stone set up by the king. It is
spoken of as “The Inscription of Pi-ankhi Mer-Amen,
king of Egypt, in the eighth century
B. C.,” and the Nimrod mentioned was probably
Nemareth, one of the petty rulers of Egypt
before referred to. The stone was discovered at
Mont Barkal, the place where it was originally
set up, and the words in brackets are those half
obliterated and restored to make out the sense.</p>

<p>When the victor entered the conquered city we
are told that “then came to him the king’s wives,
and the king’s daughters, and they praised his
majesty, after the manner of women; but his majesty
did not turn his countenance upon them.”
Ungallant majesty, who was hastening on to
further conquests and had no time for social
amenities! To Nemareth, however, who finally
came, leading “a horse with his right hand, and
holding a sistrum made of gold and lapis-lazuli
in his left,” Pi-ankhi was more condescending—nobly
forgave him, like some other nations we
have heard of, for defending his own territory,
and accompanied him to the temples, and then to
Nemareth’s stables, where he, with further condescension,
actually scolded the grooms for giving
the horses too short rations during the siege.</p>

<p>Elsewhere the queen Pi-anchi, or the next
monarch, is spoken of as “sister and wife, the
queen of Kekmi (Egypt) Ge-ro-a-ro-pi.” The
stone from which this was taken has two pictures,
the other showing also the Ethiopian queen. Says
Brugsch, “While this sister of the king is designated
as Queen of Nubia, another, who was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
a wife of Miamun-Mut, is called Queen of
Egypt.” His majesty seems to have spent a great
deal of time sailing up and down the river, yet
conquering wherever he went. And it is probable,
after the weak rulers had all submitted to him,
he returned to Ethiopia, where he died.</p>

<p>According to Manetho there was but one king
of the Twenty-fourth Dynasty, of the old line,
named Barkenrenef, who reigned for six years
only, at Sais, and there is no mention of his wife.
But meanwhile an Ethiopian, possibly the son of
Pi-ankhi, held authority at Thebes, and is called
“King of the South, Kasta.” He seems to have
married a priestess of Amon, called “divine
adorer” or “morning star,” a daughter of Osorken
III by the name of Shep-en-apt, and Sabaka,
who became king, and Amenartas, a priestess,
who held the rank of “Neter tuat,” which her
mother had also borne.</p>

<p>This Sabaka, or Sabaco, became king of the
Nubian Twenty-fifth Dynasty and reigned about
twelve years. He called himself “king of the
South and North” and “son of the sun.” He appears
to have made repairs on various temples
and was a contemporary of Sargon and Sennacherib,
kings of Assyria, with which country, as
well as with Palestine, the confused history of
Egypt, through all this period, is much associated.</p>

<p>Queen Amenartas, or, as she is elsewhere
called, Ameneritis, married Pi-ankhi, a Nubian
prince, and styled herself “royal daughter, royal
sister, royal wife.” Her husband called himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
“Uniter of two lands” and “multiplier of mighty
men.” The queen was a zealous restorer of the
temples, and added chambers and small sanctuaries
at Karnak, in one of which a fine limestone
statue of her was found. We know that she was
considered beautiful, and Brugsch says, “sweet
peace seems to hover about the features; even the
flower in her hand suggests her high mission as
reconciler of the long feud.” A part of the inscription
at her feet, on the base of the statue
at Gizeh, from which the names of her father and
mother are erased, reads: “May he (the god
Amen) grant everything that is good and pure
by which the divine nature lives, all that the
heaven bestows and the earth brings forth, to
the princess, the most pleasant, the most gracious,
the kindest and most amiable queen of
Upper and Lower Egypt, the sister of the king
(Sabaco), the ever-living, the daughter of the
deceased king (Khasta), the wife of the divine
one, Amenisitis. May she live!” Of herself
she says, “I was the wife of the divine one, a
benefactress to her city (Thebes), a bounteous
giver for her land. I gave food to the hungry,
drink to the thirsty, clothes to the naked.” So
we may judge that she was good, beautiful and
beloved.</p>

<p>There is an ivory plaque of Queen Ameneritis
in the New York Museum bearing a figure and
a cartouch of “the divine wife, Ameneritis, daughter
of Ra Khasta,” the sister, and it says also,
the wife of Sabaco of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty.
The queen is shown on the plaque kneeling on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the right, holding a lotus in each extended hand,
with a necklace and short hair, like a man’s, and
on her head a crescent and disk. There is an
alabaster statue of Queen Ameneritis on a base
of gray granite in the Gizeh Museum, which has
a rather long but slim and delicate figure; but the
head is overweighted with the wig of a god and
she has a gloomy expression—possibly brought on
by the discomfort of her wig in particular, and
her experiences of life in general. Numerous
monuments and scarabs bear her name and titles,
and Budge says that within the last few years
the British Museum has secured a remarkable
object once belonging to her. It is of glazed steatite,
with the cartouch and a short prayer cut in
hieroglyphics upon it; at one end a perforated
projection by which it was probably hung, and
on the other a sign; its use is unknown.</p>

<p>Shabataka, “son of the sun,” is accounted the
second king of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, and
was probably associated with his father in the
government. A stele now in Turin represents
Shap-en-apt with her mother, Amenar, her husband,
Pi-ankhi, and Shabataka, showing them to
be contemporaries. Brugsch says that Pi-ma or
Pi-mai means the “male cat.” King Shabataka
or Shabata-k, the son of Sabaco, is in the Barabra
language Sab-ato-ki, “the male cat’s son,”
just as a Barabran word, Kash-ato, “horse’s son,”
lies at the base of the name Kash-ta, which is
an interesting little piece of philology. An ancient
tradition, it is said, affirms that at the end
of twelve years Shabataka was taken prisoner and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
put to death at Tirhakah, who became the last
king of the dynasty, and reigned, some say eighteen,
some twenty-five years. He married the
princess Amen-tak-het, “the chief wife, the royal
sister, the royal wife.” The name of his mother
is thought to be “Akalouka,” though it is mutilated
in the inscriptions, and as she appears to
have been related to the priest-kings, it was probably
through her that Tirhakah laid claim to the
throne. It is said that when he was about
twenty years old he was proclaimed king of Napata,
and leaving his mother behind, who had
doubtless used her influence to produce this result,
he hastened to Egypt, overthrew and perhaps
slew Shabataka, who was then reigning. A stele
which he set up at Tanis gives the further information
that he was the younger but favorite
son of his father, and certainly a youth of ability,
to accomplish what he did at the early age of
twenty. He called himself, Son of Amen, and was
crowned with royal honors according to the customs
of the ancient Egyptian kings. He sent for
his mother and saluted her as the spouse of Amen,
while she, says Brugsch, “looked upon him with
the same pride which Isis felt as she gazed upon
her son Horus.” And, leaving out any moral
aspect of the question, a mother might well be
proud of such an able and energetic son. Some
believe the Taket-Amen, whom he married, was
the widow of Shabaka, first king of the Twenty-fifth
Dynasty, as he was the last king of the same,
and upon both mother and wife he bestowed high
titles and many honors. 693 or 691 B. C. is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
period given as that on which he ascended the
throne. The priests had, so far as in them lay,
made Napata a duplicate of Thebes, but not its
equal in fineness of architectural work. Tirhakah
added materially to the building and repairing
of the temples. He built one at Napata or
Gebel Barkal, subsequently destroyed by the fall
of overhanging rocks, and added to and restored
many in Egypt, in all of which no doubt his
mother, if not his wife, took great interest, as did
Queen Thi, in the work of her son Khu-en-aten.
The early part of his reign was peaceful; then
Seracherib, king of Assyria, seems to have defeated
the king of Egypt and others in battle and
caused him to flee, returning temporarily to overthrow
the governors appointed by the Assyrian
king, when Esarhaddon, the son, succeeded, only
to be again overthrown. Before the king’s death,
which is spoken of as going to his “dark doom,”
he associated with him Tannath-Amen or Tanut-Amen.
The last appearance mentioned of the
women is on a stele at Gebel Barkal, where the
king is making an offering to the god Amen and
his sister, Quelhetat, a tiny figure, is pouring out
a libation and shaking a sistrum. Behind the
king stands his wife, Kerearhenti, and while the
king has on sandals of a peculiar shape, the two
ladies are in bare feet. Still another king is called
Tandamanie, son of the sister of Tishakah, yet
the former seems accounted the final ruler of the
Twenty-fifth Dynasty.</p>

<p>Of the time from the Twenty-second to the
Twenty-fifth Dynasty, says Budge: “With this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
period the New Empire comes to an end, and we
are on the threshold of the Renaissance of the
Egyptian kingdom, with all its ancient arts and
sciences brought into connection with the Greece
of the Seventh Century before Christ.” Under
Shashanq a slight revival took place, and he ruled
the whole land, putting an end to the weak dynasties
of Tanis and Thebes. But with the close
of the priestly dynasty the glory of Thebes, which
had lasted two thousand years, had departed, and
by the time of the Ptolemies the city was almost
in ruins, and Bubastis, in the Delta, of whose festivals
Herodotus has given us an account, rose to
the first place.</p>

<p>During this time, to quote again from Budge.
“Much of the spirit of the old art had undoubtedly
been lost, the hieroglyphic script had become
chiefly an official and sacred code of writing used
for funeral prayers, historical inscriptions, etc.
And the decay of the written language, begun as
early as the Eighteenth Dynasty, was followed
by the decay of the writing, which became more
conventional and abbreviated, and the hierotic,
supplemented by the newly developed script, is
now known as Enchorial or Demotic, the peoples’
or common writing.” It is also said that the
Eighteenth Dynasty was much more elaborate
and luxurious in costume than the earlier ages,
but that the severe simplicity of the former commended
itself to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, which
we now consider.</p>

<p>The first queen seems to have been Shep-en-apt
II, a descendant of Queen Ameneritis. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
cartouch was found on a cornice, and she probably
was of higher birth than her husband, Psamthek
I or Psammetichus I, who is thought to have
been merely the son of a governor, while she
was of the blood royal. The queen was a priestess
of the grade “neter tuat,” and through her
doubtless her husband laid claim to the throne.
Psammetichus I made Sais his capital; he was,
after he was once established on the throne, less
fond of war than many of his predecessors, was
a patron of the arts and sciences, and turned his
attention to the building of temples. A distinct
Renaissance of art took place at this period, with
high finish and elaboration of detail, a certain
elegance suggestive of Greek influences. He
added a large gallery, with side chambers, to the
Serapeum at Sakkarah, and the stele found here
by Mariette are of the greatest chronological importance.
We learn from them that Psammetichus
I immediately succeeded Tirhakah, by the
records of the birth and death of the Apis bull.
His name is found in various places, Philæ and
elsewhere, and an obelisk belonging to his reign
was brought by the Emperor Augustus to Rome.
He was, some say, of Nubian, some of Lidyan
origin; and there is a glazed porcelain ushabti
figure in the British Museum, supposed to be a
likeness of him, which is very fat and jolly-looking.
He had a long reign of fifty-four years,
and both Herodotus and Diodorus give accounts
of him. The daughter of this marriage was
named Nitocris, or Nit-a-quert, and an inscription
says, Psammetichus has made a gift to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
father Amon: he “has given him his eldest daughter
Nitaquit-Shapen-apit, to be his divine spouse,
that she may shake the sistrum before him.”
This princess traveled from one part of the kingdom
to another and was received with great
honor. Sometimes the queens adopted daughters
and associated them in the governing power. One
stele found at Karnak states that the king caused
his daughter to be adopted by the lady Shep-en-apt,
the sister of Tirhakah, who had inherited
property from her father and mother, and had
previously adopted a daughter of Tirhakah’s,
Amenartas (II). Says Budge: “The stele, which
is dated in the ninth year of the reign of Psammetichus
I, proves that Tirhakah’s sister was ruling
at Thebes, as a priestess of Amen, while
Psammetichus I was reigning at Sais, and that
when Nit-aquert had been adopted by her, the
daughter of the king of Sais (Nit-aquert) took
her name also. The stele was set up to commemorate
her journey to Thebes, where she was
welcomed with the greatest joy as the heiress of
Tirhakah’s sister, and where she no doubt received
not only the property, but also the rank
and position of her whose name she took, Shap-en-apt,
the daughter of Pi-anchi and Amen-artis
I, and grand-daughter of Khasta and Shep-en-apt
I, the last named lady being a daughter of
Osorkon.” The distinction between Shep-en-apt,
the wife of the king, and the adopted mother of
her daughter, does not seem to be very clear.
Nitocris bore the same name as the last ruler of
the Sixth Dynasty, and a rose-colored sarcophagus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
inscribed with this, and having a granite
cover, is in one of the museums.</p>

<p>All this period is to some extent still a matter
of dispute among authorities as to the exact titles
and order of succession of the kings, and as to
their importance in the line; compared to their
predecessors, and even to their successors, they
were but petty rulers, holding control over but
a portion of the country, and in many cases more
like governors than chief authorities.</p>

<p>According to Professor Budge, Apries was the
next king. His Horus name was U-ah-ab-Ra,
and he is spoken of as Pharaoh Hophra in the
Bible, of whom, though he reigned from nineteen
to twenty-five years, we know little, and his wife
is not mentioned. He was overthrown by his own
general, Amasis, or Aames II, who became king,
and apparently lived in peace with his predecessor
for some years, but slew him, or permitted
him to be slain, when Apries endeavored to regain
his lost authority. Amasis II took unto himself
several wives, and welcomed and favored the
settlement of Greek colonies in Egypt. He took
the Horus name of Smen-Maat, “Stablisher of
Law,” and was apparently good-natured and affable
when not fighting. His wives are given as
the lady Shent-kheta, daughter of Peta-Nit, and
the queen, Takanath, daughter of Psammetichus I.
She had been chosen heiress of Nitocris
or Nit-a-quert, and it was doubtless to legalize
his claim to the throne that Amasis II contracted
the marriage. The female pieces in this
regal game of chess were of immense value. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
share the ladies had in the disposal of their hands
we do not learn, but in most cases it could hardly
have been an important one. Amasis II was a
builder and restorer of temples, and his name is
found in many places. At the end of his forty-fourth
year to power he died and was buried at
Sais. Queens Shep-an-apt and Nitocris, who
were priestesses of Amen, were buried at el Aso-fif,
and laid, as were other ladies of royal blood,
in tombs with finely worked ante-chambers and
inscriptions, and with false doors.</p>

<p>Psamthek or Psammetichus III, who reigned
only six months, succeeded to Amasis II, and is
sometimes omitted from the list of kings. He was
the son of the Lady Thent-kheta, and some reliefs
of him are found in a small temple near the
temple of Amasis II and Nitocris, where there
are pictures of these queens; and with him ends
the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, and we come to the
consideration of the Persian rule, numbered,
though of entirely different blood, as the Twenty-seventh
Dynasty.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_20">CHAPTER TWENTIETH.<br />
<span class="smaller">DAILY LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>“How lived, how loved, how died she?” are
questions that rise in the mind in thinking of
these royal ladies of the past. Of their individual
lives but few records remain, and it is from inscriptions
and paintings on the tombs, especially
of those of less prominence than the kings, we
may gather something of the daily life of the
queens.</p>

<p>“No nation of the earth has shown so much
zeal and ingenuity, so much method and regularity
in recording the details of private life as
the Egyptians,” says Brugsch. The kings’ tombs
chiefly celebrated their victories, the king riding
forth in his chariot, or with his captives by the
hair, in the act of slaying them, or the king—sometimes
accompanied by the queen—making
offerings to the gods, these are the favorite subjects
for the artist’s pencil, but for the details
of female life we must look elsewhere.</p>

<p>From the tomb of Ti, of the Fifth Dynasty
sometimes called the Pepys of that period, and
from the sepulchres at Beni Hassen, much has
been learned of the domestic life. Ti was a favorite
subject of the king’s, an official of high
rank, and his wife a lady of noble birth, of kin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
to the royal house. So we have pictures of all
the household arrangements, the feeding and
preparing of animals for food, the tenants, male
and female, bringing of the fruits of the earth to
their master, and he himself, after the Egyptian
manner, painted of larger size than his inferiors,
going forth to fish and to hunt. Sometimes, but
rarely, the women also accompanied their husbands
on these expeditions.</p>

<p>A statue of Ti bears the same likeness as the
figure in the tomb. It is that of a fine young
man, with regular features, and the statue of his
wife Nofre-hoteps, grand-daughter of a Pharaoh,
was also found.</p>

<p>As has been said before, the women in Egypt
had no such separate and secluded life as those
in the Eastern countries, they appear to have
mingled freely with their male relatives, and the
queens acted as regents during the absence of
their husbands, or the minority of their sons, or
sometimes ruled in their own right, from the
earliest times.</p>

<p>There were the apartments of the women or
the king’s harem, but not in such an exclusive
sense as in many other Eastern countries, nor
was the chief official in charge invariably an
eunuch.</p>

<p>The seat of government changed from time to
time under the different dynasties, so that some
of the queens lived chiefly in Memphis, some in
Thebes, some in Tanis, and, among the later
rulers, in Sais and Napata.</p>

<p>The palaces were not many stories in height,
and had, sometimes, pylons and columns in front,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the rooms were built round a succession of open
courtyards, which were shaded by palm, orange,
olive, fig and other trees, and they also had large
and beautiful gardens with fountains, especially
in the royal country villas. On the flat roofs the
people passed many hours, and disported themselves
under awnings, and slept there on rugs and
mats. In the country the houses and grounds
were usually surrounded by high walls. Large
mansions stood detached and had doors opening
on various sides, and before the columns or
colossi, at the entrance, hung ribbons or banners,
especially on festival occasions. Sometimes
a portico had a double row of columns,
with statues between, these were also colored,
and, when not of stone, were stained to represent
it. The walls and ceilings of the palaces were
brilliantly painted. They were also at times inlaid
or adorned with lapis-lazuli, which was a
favorite stone, amber and malachite. In the royal
establishments there were porticoes and vestibules,
constructed with great splendor, numerous
columns, walls glittering with jewels, and curtains
of gold tissue.</p>

<p>Floors were of stone or composition, roofs
with rafters of date palm, and transverse beams
of larger palm. Stone arches have been found
both of the time of Rameses III and Psamettichus.
Rare woods were imported, and also demanded
as tribute from foreign nations, conquered
by the Egyptians, as well as gold, silver,
precious stones and slaves.</p>

<p>After passing through the servants’ offices one
came to the store-rooms, the great dining hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the sleeping rooms, and the kitchens, and at the
further end of a piece of ground two buildings,
turned back to back, and separated by small
gardens, were the women’s apartments, which
often had shutters closed with valves to keep out
the heat.</p>

<p>The lady is spoken of as “Mistress of the
House,” or “Lady of the House,” and seemed to
have full rule over it—there is even a story that
her husband himself was bound to obey her indoors,
but this is hardly likely.</p>

<p>They had low stools for tables, flat baskets for
dinner plates, and pretty Syrian maidens were
favorite slaves. Couches, chairs, stools and
tables were of wood, bronze and silver, the feet
were often of lions’ claws, and the top of the
tables were upheld by figures of captives and
slaves. The furniture was carved with serpents,
lotus flowers and other designs, and the back of
a couch or chair was sometimes a hawk with
outspread wings, and the ends of the couch terminated
in the head of a lion or other beast.
Sometimes the couches were used for beds and
made ornamental in the day time. The Egyptians
had alabaster or wooden head rests, like the Japanese,
though the manner of hair dressing did
not seem to require it to the same extent. The
ladies’ dressing tables were covered with boxes
for ointment, bottles for cosmetics, perfumes,
and oils, and they used small metal mirrors, often
with the figure of the god Bes as a handle.</p>

<p>The costumes, adapted to the climate, were
light, especially in the earlier times, and the chief
part was of fine linen. Later there seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
have been more elaboration and heavier and
richer materials used. Wigs protected the head
of both male and female from the sun, as did the
turbans and veils of other countries. The vulture,
with outspread wings, emblem of the goddess
Mut, formed part of the queen’s head-dress,
as did the royal asp, raised in act to strike.</p>

<p>Thoth was the god of learning, called “the
baboon with shining hair and amiable face,”
the “letter writer for the gods.” Children and
youth were expected to study and exhorted, even
as far back as the time of King Pepys, “Give thy
heart to learning and love her like a mother.”
And there is also a touch of kinship with more
modern times in the statement that the boy
scholar be not allowed to oversleep and that
children left school “shouting for joy.” Severity
was sometimes used, as we read, “The youth has
a back, he attends when it is beaten.” And again,
“The ears of the young are placed in the back,
and he hears when he is flogged.” Copy books of
1700 B. C. have been found, and we possess the
school exercises of the Nineteenth and Twentieth
Dynasties. Such examples in mental arithmetic
as “There were seven men, each had seven
cats, each cat had eaten seven mice, each mouse
had eaten seven grains of barley. How much
barley had been lost in this way?” etc., etc.</p>

<p>But neither were the pleasures and amusements
of the little ones overlooked, and there
have been preserved little wooden soldiers, in
the dress of ancient times, dolls, balls and many
other things that still delight the child of to-day;
such as tops, boats, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>An olive branch was hung at the door on the
birth of a boy and a strip of woolen cloth at that
of a girl. If a new born babe cried “Ny!” it
would live, but if it cried “Nibe!” it would die.
Mothers nursed their children for three years,
and upon daughters more than upon sons was
laid the obligation of looking after their parents
in old age. The royal children had also, when
they were old enough, quarters of their own,
where they were under the charge of a tutor who
was called a nurse. Those of the higher orders,
dressed like grown people, as in the present day
the children of Holland are often the amusing
reproductions, in miniature, of their parents. The
children of the lower orders dispensed in great
part, or entirely, with any sort of covering.</p>

<p>Women were mistresses in their own house,
came and went freely and so much so that we
have an amusing story that among the lower
classes the husbands sometimes hid their wives’
shoes to keep them at home, and this before the
days of female clubs! But in spite of her privileges
child bearing and work soon aged this class
of women.</p>

<p>Among the moral precepts of the Egyptians in
a papyrus now in the Louvre is one that says,
“Ill treat not thy wife, whose strength is less
than thine. Be thou her protector,” showing that
it was no slavish relation that was expected to
exist between man and wife. And again in another
place we have a father who exhorts his
son to have regard for his mother. “It is God
Himself who gave her to thee, and now that thou
art grown up and hast a wife and house in thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
turn, remember always thine helpless infancy and
the care thy mother lavished upon thee, so that
she may never have occasion to reproach thee,
nor to raise her hands to heaven against thee, for
God would fulfill her curse.”</p>

<p>At the door of a house where there was a
bride, flowers were hung, and a vessel of water
was placed where there was a death. Fragments
of impassioned love songs have come down
to us, and though we know little of their marriage
customs, compared to their funerals, the
freedom of intercourse between the sexes and the
greater opportunity for personal acquaintance
than was usually afforded in Eastern countries,
leads to the supposition that real love matches
were not infrequent. Like the Japanese, they
compared the beloved object to blossoms and
flowers; nor were the ladies apparently behind
the gentlemen in the free expression of ardent
feeling.</p>

<p>“Thou beautiful one my wish is to be with thee
as thy wife,” says or sings the enthusiastic
maiden, and Miss Edwards and others give instances
where each strophe begins with an invocation
to a flower, thus curiously resembling the
stornelli of the Tuscan peasantry, of which every
verse begins and ends with a similar invocation
to some familiar blossom or tree.</p>

<p>This shows clearly the freedom of intercourse
permitted, and with what naivete and frankness
it is written! No effort at dissimulation in
acknowledging the artificial enhancement of her
charms. Rather perhaps did she feel herself
worthy of commendation for the pains she had
taken. It reminds one of the Southern girl who
remarked casually to a party of friends, of both
sexes: “How chilly it is this morning! Oh, now
I know why; I forgot to pencil my eyebrows!”</p>

<p>In their feasts and amusements men and women
met together and scenes in the tombs of the
Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties show ladies
discussing their earrings and jewelry, as they
might be doing to-day. To perform toilettes together,
put on necklets and exchange flowers was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
part of the entertainment, and talking, eating
and dressing all went on to the sound of music.
Birthdays and many other festivals, religious and
social, were celebrated, and there were lucky and
unlucky days for music, as well as for many other
things. It was especially to be avoided on the
fourteenth Tybi. Pollard mentions “a musical
at-home” among the pictures on the walls of the
tombs at Beni-Hassan, where two harpists, a sistrum
player and others are helping to entertain
the visitors.</p>

<p>The guests sat on chairs, or on the floor, and
did not recline at table, as was the custom of
many other Eastern nations. Their entertainment
consisted of meat, chiefly beef and kid,
geese, fish, vegetables, of which leeks and onions
formed a large part; fruit, bread, cakes, which
the bakers made in various shapes, and wine.
This was freely used and the pictures sometimes
show over indulgence on the part of the women
as well as that of the men. Sometimes there
were separate tables for men and women, sometimes
they sat together, and frequently dipped
into a common dish. They had spoons for fluids
with various designs for handles, but the use
of fingers was general for most purposes, hence
the necessity of frequent washing of the hands.</p>

<p>Of the use of leeks and onions Story says,
speaking of an Italian: “Nor is he without authority
for his devotion to those twin saints,
Apollo (or is it Cipollo) and Aglio. There is
an odor of sanctity about them, turn up our noses
as we may. The ancient Egyptian offered them
as first fruits, upon the altars of their gods, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
employed them also in the service of the dead,
and such was their attachment to them that the
followers of Moses hankered after them, despite
the manna, and longed for ‘the leeks and the
onions and the garlic, which they did eat in
Egypt freely.’ Nay the fastidious Greeks not
only used them as a charm against the ‘evil eye,’
but ate them with delight—there is a certain
specific against them—eat them yourself—you
will smell them no longer.”</p>

<p>The host and hostess sat together, flowers were
abundant, and a special token of regard was a
wreath placed around the neck of the guest.
Women were attended by women slaves who offered
them ointment and other toilette articles.
Oil poured upon the head is an attention which
would fail of appreciation in these modern times,
but was then considered so agreeable that a ball
was sometimes soaked in oil and placed on the
head of the master of the feast, so that it might
trickle down into his hair. At the close of the
banquet a mummy in miniature, richly gilded,
was carried round to remind them of their latter
end, or may it not have been to suggest that
happy as they were, they could be happier still
in another world?</p>

<p>We can imagine the olfactories of the Egyptians
to have been abnormally developed, so constantly
were they smelling flowers and holding
them under each others noses—even the sacred
nose of royalty.</p>

<p>“Smell of my lotus!” “How charming, how
delicious!” We can almost hear the echo.
Statues often show husband and wife sitting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
hand on knees, or across the breast, or sometimes
on the same chair with arms around each
other’s waist or neck. Doubtless they offered
each other what we may call the tribute of the
lotus, or the lotus courtesy, murmuring, “My
dearest, how lovely you are looking.” Chiefly
to the lady, of course, etc., etc.</p>

<p>In the earliest times musical instruments seem
to have been played chiefly by men, and women
sang without accompaniment. But later, female,
as well as male, voices combined with all sorts
of instruments. There were kettle-drums,
round and square, harps, lyres, guitars, flutes or
pipes, and lastly, specially Egyptian, the sistrum,
not melodious in sound we may judge, but used
chiefly, though not invariably in, the service of
the gods. Wilkinson gives many illustrations of
these various instruments, and the picture of a
lady with a guitar is in the Berlin museum. The
flute, so easily handled, has always seemed to be
reserved for male performers. Perhaps it takes
too much breath from the ladies, or perhaps Minerva,
having discovered that it was unbecoming,
they have all resolved to shun it.</p>

<p>Pollard speaks of a harp inlaid with gold, silver
and gems, which had been presented by a royal
personage to the temple of Amen-Ra and was
kept near the sanctuary, and of the hymns sung
to the deity to the accompaniment of this precious
instrument. We also have the song of a
harper found on the wall of the tomb of a certain
Nefer-hotep, who lived under King Horus,
of the Eighteenth Dynasty. It is called “the
word of the harper, who tarries in the tomb of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Osiris,” etc. “Celebrate the great day, O prophet.
Well is to thee fragrant resin and ointments
are laid before thee. Here are wreaths
and flowers for the vases and shoulders of thy
sister, who is pleasant to thy heart, as she rests
beside thee. Let us then sing and strike the
harp in thy presence. Leave all cares behind and
think of the joys, until the day of the voyage
comes when man casts anchor on the land which
delights in silence.”</p>

<p>To rejoice and to dance were synonymous
terms, and the royal ladies had dancing women
to perform before them as well as gymnasts.
They played draughts and checkers sitting on
the ground, while dice belonged to the subsequent
Roman period.</p>

<p>Dwarfs and deformed persons formed, occasionally,
part of the king’s or queen’s household.
As a rule dancing seems to have been rather for
princesses to look upon than share in, unless
they danced in the temples before the gods.</p>

<p>Female dancers wore short skirts, necklets,
anklets, ribbons round their bodies and wreaths
of flowers, with plain wigs that made them look
like children, and they sometimes dressed their
hair to look like a crown. Ball playing was considered
a variety of dancing. The dances of the
older period were more quiet and measured than
in later times, but none appear to have been
objectionable, according to modern standards, to
the extent of some now practiced in the East.</p>

<p>The maids of honor and princesses carried
fans, which they held over the queen, and bore
the title of “dearest friend.” When the queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
and royal ladies drove forth, it was in chariots,
sometimes of gold, and drawn by a pair of
horses (after the introduction into Egypt of that
valuable animal, of which there is no representation
on the monuments of the very earliest
times), adorned with plumes, while an umbrella
was occasionally fixed to the chariot to protect
them from the sun.</p>

<p>But the queen’s highest position was as
priestess, concubine, daughter, wife, of the god.
Egyptian queens or princesses held the service
of Amon or Jove and the queen followed in the
king playing on the sistrum and making offerings.
No queen held the highest priestly office,
but they were called “singers of Amon,” and
“wives of the god.” Occasionally the mummy of
the daughter will be found among the priests, the
mother among the royalties.</p>

<p>The queen was “Neter-Hemt, prophetess,”
“Neter-hemet, divine wife,” or “Neter-tut, divine
handmaid.” The sistrum was from eight to
eighteen inches in length, Hathor-headed, cow-eared,
and sometimes inlaid with silver or gilt
and the noise was supposed to frighten away
Typho, the spirit of evil. The action of shaking
was called “Art Ses.” A sistrum in either hand
standing before the altar of the god, the queen
had reached the highest pinnacle of human greatness
or human ambition.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_21">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIRST.<br />
<span class="smaller">PERSIAN QUEENS.</span></h2>

<p>With the conquests of Cambyses Egypt became
subject to a new set of rulers, by whom its manners
and customs were, in a degree, changed or
modified. Yet such are its inherent characteristics
that it has been often said of Egypt, as of
Greece, that she rather impressed herself upon
her masters, than was impressed by them.
Through the Persian period, to that of the Ptolemies,
women retired into the background, and
no one name comes into prominence, at least in
an official character. It is in connection with
Persia rather than with Egypt that we learn of
the queens, some, perhaps most of whom, remained
in their own land, while their husbands
were absent, engaged in wars and conquests.
The kings, distracted by wars in all directions,
often made hurried visits to their conquered territories,
leaving satraps and deputies to rule in
their absence. The legal queen, we may believe,
tarried at home, while the warriors left
their women behind or were accompanied by
their concubines, to whom no formal honors were
paid.</p>

<p>Hence it is more than possible that although
nominally queens of Egypt but few of them ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
resided in the country, those of the kings who
reigned longest, of course, being most likely to
do so. The Persian kings usually chose their
wives from among their own nobility, the concubines
were of varied nationality.</p>

<p>In thinking of these royal ladies we seem to see
a veiled figure, with beautiful shining eyes, wandering
among the gardens of the palaces, which
gardens were said to be less formally laid out
than those of the native Egyptians, but she is
silent. Or behind palace walls we hear the echo
of distant music, and perchance the sound of soft
singing, to the accompaniment of a lute, or some
other instrument. If she looked forth from her
windows it was from behind curtains and lattice
work, and if she appeared in public it was with a
veiled countenance, only the eyes showing.</p>

<p>The ruins at Persepolis, Ecbatana, the capital
of Media, and Suza acquaint us with the construction
of Persian palaces, which differ somewhat
from the Egyptian. When in Egypt the
Persian kings probably accepted, to a considerable
extent, the architecture and general arrangements
of that country. Madame Ragozin gives
us, from an earlier source, an account of the
palace built by Darius, at Persepolis. “A central
hall flanked by two sets of apartments, of
four rooms each, with a front entrance, composed
of a door and four windows, opening on a
porch, supported by four columns, and forming
at the same time the landing between the two
flights of stairs,” such the ruins disclose. “The
throne and audience hall, the reception and banqueting
hall, was two hundred and twenty-seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
feet every way, with cedar and cypress beams upborne
by a hundred columns ten rows of ten,
tall and slender, they rested lightly on their inverted
flower base, carrying the raftered ceilings
proudly and with ease on the strong, bent
necks of the animals which adorned their capitals,
of that peculiarly and matchless fanciful
type which is the most distinctive feature of
Akhaemenian architecture.”</p>

<p>The king’s throne was supported by rows of
warriors and he wore the flowing Median garb,
or the tight-fitting Persian doublet and hose. The
master of ceremonies kept his hand before his
mouth, and all who approached kept their hands
hidden in their sleeves in token of peaceful intentions.
The remains of the palace of Xerxes,
the Ahasuerus of the Bible, have also been found,
similar to, but not so fine as, those of Darius.
The buildings were usually of one story and set
on a terrace or platform, sometimes made of
columns. Of the Great Hall of Xerxes Mr. Fergusson
says: “We have no cathedral in England
that at all comes near it in dimensions; nor indeed
in France and Germany is there one that
covers so much ground. Cologne comes nearest.”</p>

<p>Of the women’s appointed place we read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Between the porphyry pillars that upheld</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The rich moresque-work of the roof of gold</div>
<div class="verse">Aloft the Haram’s curtained galleries rise</div>
<div class="verse">Where through the silken net-work glancing eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">From time to time, like sudden gleams that glow</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Through autumn clouds, shine on the pomp below.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The gardens attached to the palaces we may
well believe favorite resorts of the queen and her
attendant ladies. Shaded paths, sparkling fountains,
retired resting places and beds ablaze with
flowers, all these made a charming retreat. In
the midst was usually a hall, kiosk or arbor,
raised on several steps, a fountain in the centre
making a musical murmur and spreading coolness
around. It was enclosed with gilded lattices
over which rioted in careless grace vines
of jassamine, honeysuckle and other creepers—a
fair green wall overhung and protected by tall
trees. Here, too, doubtless the king enjoyed some
of his hours of leisure, wrapped about with the
perfume of violets and sipping a sherbet of violets
and sugar, a favorite drink in Persia. We
learn of a “Betel-carrier and Taster of Sherbets
to the Emperor.” Lest poison might secretly be
prepared for the royal palate it was always necessary
to have a taster, the first victim in case of
evil intent. To this other duties were added such
as “Chief Holder of the Girdle of Beautiful
Forms and Grand Nazir or Chamberlain of the
Harem.” King Canute sat on the brink of the
ocean and ordered it to come no further; King
Darius or Xerxes laid a similar prohibition on
the waxing proportions of his spouse—neither
perhaps was strictly obeyed by Dame Nature.
At least it appears to have been the duty of the
“Holder of the Girdle of Beautiful Forms” to do
what he could—“Permit me, most gracious Lady.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Alas, one inch beyond the line of beauty!” Subsequently
perhaps starvation and tears to insure
return to the stipulated measure.</p>

<p>Costly materials rather than shape were prized
by the Persians, and their ornaments were less
ornate and elaborate than those of the Egyptians;
rings and bracelets were of plain gold, collars
of twisted gold, but comparatively unartificial.
Their household utensils too seem to have been
few and simple in pattern, a covered dish and
a goblet with an inverted saucer over it are often
pictured in the hands of the royal attendants.
Occasionally, but rarely, we hear of Persian
women indulging in manly sports, as Roxane,
daughter of Idernes, and half sister of Terituchmes
was skilled in the use of the bow and
the javelin.</p>

<p>The queen mother, when the widow of the late
king, took precedence of her daughter-in-law, the
wife of the reigning monarch, had certain privileges,
peculiar to herself, was attended by a band
of eunuchs and dined with her son in the women’s
apartment. Though not nominally in public life
her influence was often very great and at times
used or abused most cruelly.</p>

<p>As in the earlier times, certain cities in Egypt
were assigned to furnish the revenues of the
queen, and that of Anthylla was appointed to
provide her with shoes. This must also, it would
seem, have applied to the females of her household,
as a single pair of feet, even though royal,
could have been but a slight tax on the revenues
of a town.</p>

<p>To return to the thread of history which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
are following. King Apries was overthrown and
succeeded by Amasis, who, usurper though he
was, seems to have reigned long and well. The
date given for the close of the reign of Apries is
B. C. 579, and Amasis ruled for forty-five years;
his son Psammetic III had been on the throne
but a few months when Cambyses conquered
Egypt.</p>

<p>Syria appears to have been held by Egypt during
the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties,
while later Egypt disputed its possession with
Assyria, and lastly the Ptolemies and Califs ruled
it from Egypt. But the Egypt of which we now
make study was no longer a country united under
one head and going forth to conquer and demand
tribute from surrounding nations. She was alternately
divided under the sovereignty of a number
of petty kings or ground under the heel of some
all-conquering but more or less temporary master.
Wars and internal dissentions were constant,
with now and then a longer period of comparative
peace and tranquility, in which the country had
breathing space to recover from the desolation
and ruin that had preceded it.</p>

<p>The Persians, numbered as the Twenty-seventh
Dynasty, came in as masters who desired rather
to trample upon than conciliate their subjects.
They outraged the sensibilities and prejudices of
the people, and, it is said, that the arts, long in
decline, received a severe blow from their invasion,
while many of the finest buildings in Egypt
were mutilated and destroyed by Cambyses, hence
revolts against the new authority were frequent.
Cambyses himself appears to have acted at times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
like a cruel madman, and whether the story of
his stabbing the revered Apis bull be true or
not, and, like all old stories, its authenticity is
sometimes disputed, the incident is but an illustration
of the general course which he pursued.</p>

<p>He was son of Cyrus the Great, King of Persia,
said to be the grandson of the Median King
Astyages, and his mother was said by Ctesias to
be Amytias and, by Herodotus, to be Cassandane
or Kassomdane, daughter of Pharnespes, a member
of the royal family, who died before her husband.
Cambyses was in every way inferior to his
father. The children of this marriage were two
sons and three daughters, the sons Cambyses and
Smerdis, the daughters Atossa, Roxana and Artystone.</p>

<p>Cyrus left his kingdom to his elder son, but
placed so much power also in the hands of the
younger that Cambyses caused his brother to be
secretly murdered that his rights might be undisputed.
Following the Egyptian custom, or setting
up a law for himself, since it does not seem
to have been the habit of the Persian monarchs,
he married his two sisters, Atossa and Roxana.
The Persian judges said it was not lawful for a
man to marry his sister, but the king could of
course do as he pleased. The unfortunate Roxana
excited the fury of this monster by mourning
for her brother Smerdis, and is said also to have
been killed by Cambyses with a kick. A Greek
inscription at Behistan affirms that Smerdis was
murdered before Cambyses started for Egypt;
that the latter committed suicide in the end; that
the rebellion was a religious one, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Magian was not Smerdis but Gomates, and the
discovery of the imposture is not as generally
given. Other authorities claim that Smerdis was
murdered by Cambyses’ orders during his absence,
but the affair seems much involved in mystery.</p>

<p>Cambyses adopted as his Horus name “Horus,
the Unifier of Two Lands,” and styled himself
“Born of Ra.” For a third wife he took Nitetis,
daughter of the Previous Egyptian king, Apries,
but sent to him as the daughter of Amasis, the
reigning monarch. Upon this deception, it is asserted,
hinged the invasion of Egypt. There
seems to be a discrepancy in dates, some holding
that Nitetis would have been too old a bride for
Cambyses, and therefore it must have been Cyrus
that took her to wife, and that Cambyses was
her son rather than her husband. But this tale is
believed to be of Egyptian origin, made up to remove
from their shoulders the stigma of being
merely a conquered people and set up a pretence
that Cambyses had some legal right to the throne
by descent from an Egyptian princess.</p>

<p>Another tale is thus given by Herodotus. A
Persian woman visited the harem of King Cyrus,
was struck with the beauty of the children of Cassadane
and praised them greatly to their mother.
“Yet would you believe it,” said Cassadane,
“Cyrus neglects me, the mother of such children
as these, to pay honor to an Egyptian interloper!”
On this Cambyses, her eldest son, a boy of ten
years of age, exclaimed: “Therefore, mother,
when I am a man, I will turn Egypt upside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
down!” Which threat, if ever made by him, was
most surely fulfilled.</p>

<p>Supposing Nitetis to have been the grand-daughter,
rather than the daughter of Apries, the
dates become more intelligible. It is this period
of history that Ebers has selected for his romance
of an “Egyptian Princess,” which, like all his historical
novels, if lacking perhaps great vitality in
the individual characters, has a carefully studied
and interesting ground work of historical fact.
The truth or the tradition, which ever it be, runs
thus: Amassis, King of Egypt, sent by request to
the King of Persia, suffering with some trouble of
the eyes, his special oculist. The physician, resentful
of long ostracism from home and friends,
suggested to his patron that he should demand in
marriage the daughter of the Egyptian king. The
plan was proposed not in good faith, but with a
desire to make trouble.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reputation of Cambyses was already
evil and well known. At any rate, the proposal
produced consternation rather than joy and
satisfaction in the circle of the bride-elect. Possibly
Amasis held with special tenderness the
daughter in question. Be this as it may, he sent
not the princess demanded, but one who was
probably considered of inferior dignity. Doubtless
she went adorned in regal splendor that the
deception might not be suspected. Her finger tips
would have been tinged with henna to look like
branches of coral; she would perhaps wear the
Persian head dress, composed of a light golden
chain work set with small pearls, with a thin
gold plate pendant about the size of a crown piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
on which was impressed an Arabian prayer and
which hung upon the cheek below the ear. The
kohl’s jetty dye would give that “long, dark, languish
to the eye.” A small coronet of jewels
would be placed upon her head and over all a
rosy veil. The veils the Eastern women wore
over the head were coquettishly managed to add
to their attractions. Says the poet in “Lalla
Rooke”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Veiled by such a mask as shades</div>
<div class="verse">The features of young Arab maids,</div>
<div class="verse">A mask that leaves but one eye free</div>
<div class="verse">To do its best in witchery.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Arab women wear black masks prettily disposed,
and Niebuhr mentions their showing but
one eye in conversation, and again says Moore:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And bright the glancing looks they hide</div>
<div class="verse">Beneath their litters roseate veils.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So Nitetis, hardly a happy bride, was wedded
to the Persian king, and “nightingales warbled
their enchanting notes and rent the thin veils of
the rosebud and the rose,” according to a favorite
image of the Oriental poets. But not joy,
peace and happiness resulted—rather wars and
bloodshed. Perhaps in innocence, perhaps in malice,
the new queen revealed the secret of her
identity to the king. Since he did not put her
to death we may believe that she herself had
some attractions for him, but the deception he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
would not forgive and seized upon it, only too
gladly, as a pretext for invading Egypt.</p>

<p>Across the desert which protected Egypt on
the northeast marched Cambyses and his army,
while his fleet, supplied by the Phoenician cities
and the Greeks of Asia Minor, blockaded the
Egyptian king (Psammetic III, only recently
come to the throne) in Memphis. The herald was
sent in a Greek vessel to demand surrender. The
Egyptians, with mad and cruel folly, courting
their own destruction, since such an act would
be sure to infuriate the invader, seized the ship
and tore the crew to pieces. If not before, from
that moment their doom was sealed. Cambyses
took Memphis, B. C. 525, on the pyramid plain,
where later Napoleon bade his soldiers do their
best, for the Centuries looked down upon them.
It is said that Cambyses put cats and other sacred
animals before his troops so that the Egyptians
were afraid to attack. Be this as it may, the Persians
obtained the mastery, and Cambyses took
his revenge on Amasis for the affront offered
him by causing his dead body to be burned.</p>

<p>One cannot help thinking of the homely phrase,
“Give a dog a bad name,” in connection with this
ancient king, all the ruin that occurred for hundreds
of years seems set down to the credit of
Cambyses, who, with the most evil intent in the
world, could hardly have accomplished all that
was claimed for him. He is said to have left
nothing unburnt in Thebes that fire would consume.
“An earthquake and Cambyses,” says Curtis,
“divide the shame of the partial destruction of
Memnon.” An old inscription at the base of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
statue reads: “I write after having heard Memnon.
Cambyses has wounded me, a stone cut into
the image of the sun king. I had once the sweet
voice of Memnon, but Cambyses has deprived me
of the accents which express joy and grief.”</p>

<p>Tradition also says that Cambyses threw down
the magnificent statues set up to adorn the temple
of victory, built by Seti I at old Quernah, yet
Pliny has preserved a story that the same king
was so struck by the beauty of a certain statue
that he ordered the flames which he had kindled
extinguished at its base.</p>

<p>It is probable that all his other crimes paled
into insignificance in the eyes of the Egyptians
before his murder of their sacred bull. For this
his memory would have been execrated forever
had it been his only deed of violence. But whereas
the Persians spoke of Cyrus as “Father” they
called Cambyses “Despot” or “Master”; ferocity
and cruelty seemed to distinguish most of his actions.</p>

<p>Both the hawk and the bull appeared as emblems
of royalty and divinity among the Egyptians
from the earliest times. But the bull was
also highly regarded in Assyria, India and among
other ancient nations. The hawk was sacred to
the sun, the Apis bull, the living image of Osiris,
the incarnation of a source of life and creative
energy. Upon this animal, so revered and worshipped,
Cambyses dared to lay what was deemed
a sacrilegious hand; in the eyes of his new subjects
he could have committed no greater crime.
Says one writer: “At Memphis the Apis bull
was bred, nurtured and honored with all the devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
that Asiatic superstition lavished upon
the representative of their miscalled deities.”</p>

<p>It was said of the god Apis that “his glory was
sought for in all Egypt,” and an inscription
reads: “He was found after some months in the
city of Ho-shed-abot. He was solemnly introduced
into the temple of Ptah, beside his father,
the Memphian god Phthah of the South Wall by
the high priest in the temple of Phthah, the great
prince of the Mashuash Petise, the son of the high
priest of Memphis and great prince of the Mashuash,
Takelut and of the princess of royal race,
Thes-bast-per.”</p>

<p>The priests would search through the land for
the new Apis, which must have certain marks
upon it. The rules required that the young bull
should be black, with a white triangle on his
forehead, the likeness of a vulture on his back,
a crescent moon on his side, two kinds of hair
in his tail and an excrescence under his tongue
like the sacred beetle. Naturally it took a long
time to find just such an animal, and the time between
the death of one and the finding of another
was kept as a period of fasting and mourning.
It is said that when the old Apis outlived twenty-five
years he was quietly drowned by the priests,
and the bodies of the dead bulls were embalmed
and buried with royal honors in tombs in the
desert. When the new bull was found it was
a period of great rejoicing. The mother and calf
were brought to the temple and housed with all
honor and regard. The bull was consulted as an
oracle by offering it food, and the omen was favorable
or the reverse, as it accepted or refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
it. This doubtless gave opportunity to the priests
and care-takers to direct the matter as they saw
fit. A hungry bull would be much more apt to
give a favorable response, as one may well perceive
than an already satiated one.</p>

<p>Memphis, the “City of the White Wall” which
was to the Greeks as Cairo is to us now, the typical
Oriental city, was especially celebrated for its
worship of Apis or Hapi and was selected for its
residence because one of the limbs of Osiris, killed
by Typhon, the evil spirit, were found there. One
pauses to wonder at the curious mingling of
power and powerlessness which the ancients attributed
to their gods. Proof against all dangers
and performing miracles of all sorts they yet at
times, even the very greatest of them, suffered
and “died like men.”</p>

<p>Thus the sacred bull, selected by certain particular
marks and guarded and cared for with
special reverence, was looked upon as the incarnation
of the god. It is in the Serapium (or bulls’
burying place), a word regarded as a contraction
of Osiris-Apis, that various tablets and inscriptions
were found which give the chief dates and
information which we possess as regards the
reigns of certain kings. The records of the Apis
bulls are more complete than the Mnevis bulls,
and he is spoken of as “a fair and beautiful image
of the soul of Osiris.”</p>

<p>It was upon this adored treasure that Cambyses
cruelly and unwisely vented his evil temper. After
the conquest of Egypt he again engaged in other
aggressive wars and, returning unsuccessful from
one of his expeditions against Nubia and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
more morose and ill-natured than usual, he found
the people celebrating one of their religious festivals,
and, thinking, or pretending to think, that
they were deriding him and rejoicing at his ill-success,
he poured out the viols of his wrath. “Oh
stupid mortals!” he exclaimed. “Are these your
gods? Creatures of flesh and blood and sensible
to the touch of steel!” and he caused the sacred
bull to be brought forth and stabbed it in the thigh
and put several of the priests to death.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting events of modern
times was the discovery by Mariette of the long
lost Serapeum in 1850. The temple had been
described by Strabo, but the lapse of years and
the drifting sands of the desert had obliterated
it from memory and hidden it from sight. Wandering
in the neighborhood of the Step Pyramid
of Sakkarah, the oldest in the world, believed to
have been erected only eighty years after the
time of Menes, this noted archaeologist stumbled
against an object which proved to be the head
of a sphinx, and immediately the description of
Strabo came into his mind. At once, with characteristic
patience and determination, he set his
men to work and had the immense satisfaction
after innumerable difficulties of discovering the
avenue of sphinxes which led to the Serapeum
and the buried temple itself. It extended 640
feet into the solid rock, with long galleries, sixty-four
vaulted chambers on either side and a vaulted
roof twenty feet high, while the breadth of
the gallery was about the same. In one chamber
he discovered the Apis, who died in the sixtieth
year of Rameses II, so fresh and undisturbed did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
this seem that the finger marks could be seen on
the walls and footprints in the sand. A human
mummy, which Mariette at first took to be an
Apis, was also discovered, and proved by the inscription
to be that of the favorite son of Rameses
II Kha-em-uas, high priest of the temple of Ptah
and governor of Memphis. The body was covered
with jewels, gold chains and amulets, precious
and gold washed, all of which are now in
the Louvre. Huge granite sarcophagi were discovered
in twenty-four cells, bearing the name of
the king on the throne at the time the Apis was
buried. The most recent mummies discovered
were from the time of Psammetichus II of the
Twenty-sixth Dynasty, 660 B. C., to a Ptolemy
Dynasty 500 years later.</p>

<p>At certain periods the votaries of Serapis celebrated
festivals in the temple and recorded them
on votive tablets, which were found in the galleries
of the Serapeum. From these we gather
that the reign of Psammetichus was brief; that
there were six kings of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty,
666 B. C.; that following Psammetichus I
came Necho II, in the sixteenth year of whose
reign an Apis was born. That another was installed
in the temple of Ptah in the first year of
the reign of Psamettic II; that an Apis died in
the twelfth year of Apries, and that this king was
succeeded by Amasis and Psammetic III.</p>

<p>Unable to carry away all of his finds to place
them in greater security in various museums, Mariette
buried some of them temporarily near the
spot, which Miss Edwards says was betrayed and
sold by the Arabs to a certain Austrian arch-duke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
who took possession and carried them to Trieste.
Among them was said to be the bull stabbed by
Cambyses, while in the rooms of the New York
Historical Society the same, or very similar,
mummy of an Apis is to be seen. Whether the
wound of the bull proved fatal and he was secretly
buried by the priests, or whether he survived till
the fourth year of Darius’ reign, as the Serapeum
tablets seem to indicate, is a mooted point. Ne-chatano,
a subsequent and native Egyptian king,
is believed to have rebuilt or restored the Serapeum
in 350 B. C. One tablet in the collection
records the death of an Apis in the sixth year of
Cambyses.</p>

<p>But the reign of this cruel king at last came
to an end. A revolt took place in Persia, the murdered
Smerdis was represented by an imposter,
who for some time deceived the people, and Cambyses,
hastening home, either died or, some say,
committed suicide by stabbing himself with his
dagger, so runs the legend, while mounting a
horse in the same place as he had wounded the
bull. It was the custom of the Egyptian women
to go two days in the week to the tombs of their
dead and to throw upon them a sweet smelling
herb, like basil, but for Cambyses we can imagine
no such mourning was made. The world was
well rid of a monster, and even his wives must
have felt that they were freed from the tyrant.
Custom permitted the Persian king to have several
legal wives, but one only was the legal queen.
Atossa probably occupied this position. Her experiences
in husbands were varied and her charms
probably great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>Magus, by others called Gomates, personated
the dead Smerdis or Bardiya and took Cambyses’
wives, but kept them in separate establishments
that his secret might not be discovered. The
story goes that for some previous crime the ears
of the impostor had been cut off, but that he covered
the place with his hair. In his sleep, however,
one of his wives, the daughter of Otanes,
suspecting his impersonation, passed her hand
over his head, and thus his fraud was made public.
In the end he was slain by Darius, a member
of the royal family, who now laid claim to
the throne and proved to be an excellent sovereign.</p>

<p>He again took Queen Atossa to wife, and her
influence over him is said to have been unbounded,
and she became the mother of Xerxes,
who succeeded him. She survived Salamis and
was actually, in part, contemporary with Herodotus,
from whom we derive the information regarding
her so numerous marriages. Cyrus had
one legal wife, Cambyses three and Darius five.</p>

<p>His wives are given as first a daughter of Gobryas,
whose children were Artabazanes, and two
others—Atossa, by whom he had Xerxes; Hystaspes,
Akhaemenes and Masistes; Arystone, by
whom he had Arsames and Gobryas; Parmys, by
whom he had Ariomardas, and, lastly, Phrataguma,
by whom he had Abrocome and Hyperanthe.</p>

<p>Darius seems to have been the one Persian
king beloved by the Egyptians, towards whom
he showed himself in great contrast to his predecessor,
most considerate and regardful, associating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
with the priests and studying their theology.
During his lifetime he was called a god
by the Egyptians and he is the only Persian
king whose name is accompanied with a titular
shield and whose phonetic shield bears the crest
of the vulpauser and disk ‘son of the sun.’ The
only one whose phonetic name is accompanied by
a pre-nomen, like those of the ancient kings. He
obtained while living the title of “Divus” and received,
after death, the same honors as the native
Egyptian sovereigns, of the earlier centuries.
On an ornament of porcelain in the museum at
Florence he is called “beneficent god.” He is
even represented in sculpture as worshipping the
Egyptian god Athor, and the mummy of Osiris,
with the lighted lamp, the emblem of fire (the
great divinity of Persia) in each hand. But in
spite of this another authority states that no
Persian king’s name is found on a public monument
in Egypt.</p>

<p>When the Persian kings were present in Egypt
comparative peace reigned, but, when they left
the government in the hands of deputies, revolts
were numerous. Darius put his satrap Aryandes
to death for presuming to coin money; he being
so distasteful to the Egyptians that they were
on the point of revolt when Darius returned.
But spite of the personal popularity of Darius
the Persian yoke was hateful to the Egyptians,
and when the king’s back was once turned, his
presence withdrawn, and he became involved in
other wars, they again rose against the invaders.</p>

<p>While preparing to crush Egypt Darius died,
leaving the task to Xerxes, his son by the beloved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Atossa. His first wife had been a daughter of
Gobryas and her son, older than Xerxes, would
naturally have, succeeded, but Artobazanes had
been born before his father became king, and
this fact, coupled doubtless with the paramount
influence of Queen Atossa, decided the question
in favor of Xerxes, who had been born after his
father ascended the throne.</p>

<p>For the few succeeding dynasties the balance
of power swung between the native rulers and
their Persian conquerors, Xerxes or Khshaiarsha,
whose wife was named Amestris, reconquered
Egypt in the second year of his reign, and increased
its burdens. He also seems to have made
love to the wife of his brother Masistes and to
her daughter, the wife of his son Darius, and
because Xerxes gave this daughter-in-law Artaynte,
for whom he had an unlawful affection,
a beautiful mantle, woven by his wife Amestris,
the queen had the mother of her rival most
cruelly mutilated. Xerxes was himself subsequently
murdered, apparently a not undeserved
fate.</p>

<p>Under Artaxerxes his son, who succeeded,
B. C. 465, the Egyptians again threw off the
hated yoke, but after various vicissitudes were
reconquered. This prince was said to be largely
under the influence of his mother Amestris and
his sister Amytir, both women of ill-regulated
lives. His only legal wife was Damaspia, but
he had many children by his concubines. Several
native rulers who reigned briefly and were
murdered in succession, came next. Then we
have Darius II, previously called Ochus, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
subsequently Nothus, said to be one of the seventeen
illegitimate sons of Artaxerxes I, who married
Paraysatis, daughter of Xerxes I. Darius
II reigned nineteen years and was followed by
Artaxerxes II, said to be the last Persian king
who left any memorial of himself in Egypt. He
styled himself “Beloved of Amen-Ra,” and
“Beautiful god, lord of the two lands.”</p>

<p>During this period the Egyptians associated
themselves with the Athenians and Amyrtaeus, a
descendant of the Saite kings, ruled for a period
of six years. He is sometimes considered identical
with a certain Amen-rut and a portion of
the coffin of his daughter, Ar-Bast-utchat-nifu,
is in the Berlin museum, but that the two are
the same king is questioned by others. Amyrtaeus
was deemed of sufficient importance, however,
to be counted as the Twenty-eighth Dynasty,
but we find no mention of his queen.</p>

<p>Nepherites is given as the only king of the
Twenty-ninth Dynasty, from Mendes, and
reigned some years, but again we learn nothing
of the queen. Akhoris or Haker was first king of
the Thirtieth Dynasty, he repaired various temples,
and his name is found in several places.
Several unimportant kings followed, one authority
says that the revolt of the Medes permitted
the authority of the Egyptian king Hakis,
Akhorus or Achorus, of whom we have made
mention, and of whom some memorials are found
here and there, and a sphinx in Paris bears his
name. The kings who succeeded are regarded
as of little moment, Nectanebus I is frequently
considered the next king and he succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
keeping the authority in his hands, some say
ten, some eighteen years. He seems to have been
capable both as a soldier and a ruler, and somewhat
revived the pomp which had been so characteristic
of the earlier kings. He built some
temples and shrines and repaired many of the
important ones, and his name appears in various
places. An obelisk cut by this king (whose name
occurs at Philae), but which was not inscribed,
was afterwards floated down the Nile by Ptolemy
Philadelphus and erected in honor of his sister
in the Arsinoite home. The fine stone lions once
at the Fontane di Termine at Rome, but now
placed in the Egyptian Museum in the Vatican,
are said to be the last piece of Egyptian sculpture
executed under native princes. He seems to have
been one of the few kings who defeated the Persians.
Nectanebus II, who was both a builder
and a warrior, was the only other king of importance
of this dynasty.</p>

<p>Ochus, Artaxerxes III, of the Thirty-first
Dynasty, out-heroded Herod and led to the final
collapse of the Persian power in Egypt. He
emulated and even surpassed Cambyses, causing
the sacred bull not only to be killed, but cooked
and eaten at a feast. Darius Codomanus was
the last Persian king, and when Alexander came
as conqueror of these hated rulers the Egyptians
made him welcome. He at once began a conciliatory
policy, sacrificed to Apis, built a temple
to Isis, and caused himself to be adopted by and
proclaimed son of Zeus-Amon. He remained
some time, founded the city of Alexandria, placed
rulers over Egypt and departed from Memphis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
B. C. 331. Living he never again saw the land,
but his corpse was brought back from Babylon
and deposited in a sarcophagus in Alexandria.</p>

<p>The favorite stone of the Persian gem engravers
was chalcedony, a semi-transparent,
white quartz, the blue variety of which is the
sapphire and on this one sometimes finds engraved
the head of a Persian king.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_22">CHAPTER TWENTY-SECOND.<br />
<span class="smaller">ROXANE.</span></h2>

<p>The Persian yoke had become so intolerable to
the Egyptians that they were prepared to accept
any other conqueror with positive enthusiasm,
and the Macedonian Alexander and his followers
were welcomed rather as friends than as enemies
and hated masters.</p>

<p>The colossal empire created by the splendid
military audacity combined with the judicious
tolerance of Alexander the Great may be said to
have dropped to pieces by its own weight, and a
comparatively few years after his short career
was ended, for he died at thirty-two, it had been
partitioned among his generals.</p>

<p>Roxane or Roxana, first or chief wife of Alexander,
for he married others later, could only in
a theoretic sense be called Queen of Egypt, as of
other countries of which her husband was master.
The mad rush of battle and conquest left little
time for the ostentatious display of royalty.
Alexander was rather a great general than a
reigning king intent upon the government and internal
improvement of the various countries under
his sway. He seemed to have hardly time to
place one crown upon his head before he was
fighting for another, and the outward trappings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
of his office must have been military rather than
royal. There could have been little opportunity
for his wife to realize the grandeur of her position.
Hence it was, in all probability, not till
after his death that Roxane, the queen, entered
Egypt, and then it was rather as a captive than
as a reigning princess.</p>

<p>By a previous connection, not a legal marriage,
with Barsine, widow of Darius’ best Greek
general, Memnon, Alexander had a son named
Herakles, who afterwards laid some claim to the
kingdom, but it was Roxane, a Bactrian princess,
famed for her beauty, that he first made his lawful
wife. She was the daughter of Oxyartes,
“who commanded the Sagdian rock for Darius,”
and on the reduction of this fortress, married
the conqueror.</p>

<p>We can picture to ourselves a beautiful mountain
region, the mad onrush of troops, the clang
of arms, the brief delirium of a battle and then
a cessation of hostilities and the natural man
seeking once more excitement in amusement. It
is said that it was at a feast or drinking bout,
where dancing was also going on, that Alexander
first saw and at once fell in love with the handsome
Roxane, spoken of by one writer as “of
surpassing beauty and a grace rarely seen among
barbarians.”</p>

<p>Alexander himself was a handsome man in
the perfection of manhood. Born 356 B. C. he
was twenty-nine years of age at the time of this
marriage, which is said to have united two strains
of Indo-European blood. The bride was probably
much younger. Of him many likenesses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
usually busts or profiles on coins, exist. There
is a bust of him in the British Museum, a terra-cotta
in Munich, and he appears as the sun-god
in the Capitoline Museum in Rome, as the Vernal-sun
in a marble relief in the Louvre, in Paris,
beside other places and his head on the coins.
He was fair and ruddy, with finely cut features,
an alert agreeable expression, a look of power
and intellect and a full eye which could blaze
with anger or melt into tenderness.</p>

<p>As opposites attract, and judging by the race
from which she sprang (Bactria was approximately
the present Bokhara and “has no small
claim to be called the cradle of our present civilization”),
we may believe Roxane to have been
dark as Alexander was fair. A soft yet brilliant
black or brown eye, raven tresses, ideal in feature
and in form, and endowed with every grace.
Alexander had proved himself invulnerable to
many of the sex. The wife and daughter of
Darius—women famed for their good looks—were
treated by him with a respect and indifference
to their charms unusual in such times and
in such cases. He worshipped the god of war
rather than the god of love. But the fair Roxane
proved irresistible. He left her for a brief
time and then returned and married her. To be
the bride of the conqueror, especially when he
was young and handsome, what more could any
maiden desire? “None but the brave deserve the
fair,” physical courage was the most admired
of all the virtues, holding its place even in these
latter days, and of that Alexander had a large
share, as well as of other lovable qualities, impulsive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
generous and large-minded, as he often
showed himself. He wore a great plume of white
feathers on either side of his helmet which made
his ever a conspicuous object of the field of
battle, yet he bore a charmed life and escaped
injury.</p>

<p>Cruel at times, he was still warm-hearted. Between
his mother and himself existed a strong
affection, and in a quarrel between her and his
father, Philip, he took her side and fled with
her. She was the imperious, passionate and fanatical
Olympias, daughter of Neoptolemus, king
of Epirus, to which country she returned with
the son who inherited some of her traits, and
to whom she was passionately attached. Plutarch
gives many pleasant anecdotes of Alexander
and refers to the numerous letters he
wrote to his mother and other relatives and
friends. He deprecated his mother’s interference
with matters of war and state, but bore her
reproaches with patience, and when Antipater
wrote to him complaining of her he nobly replied,
“One tear of a mother effaces a thousand
such letters as these.”</p>

<p>With Alexander the name of Cleopatra is introduced
into Egypt, where it was borne by a bewildering
number of the subsequent royal family.
His father put away his mother and married a
second wife of that name, and to his sister Cleopatra,
who married her uncle Alexander, her
mother’s brother, King of Epirus, he was, as
well as to Olympias, warmly attached.</p>

<p>The marriage of the conqueror with the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
princess placated the Bactrians and peace was
restored. But the restless spirit of Alexander
know no pause—he could not stay to dally in the
arms of his love, no matter how beautiful, ambition
was even a more powerful mistress and he
rushed onward to new conquests.</p>

<p>He had adopted a conciliatory policy towards
the Jews, he showed the same in Egypt. He sacrificed
to the gods of the land, to Apis in particular,
in marked and acceptable contrast to
the conduct of Cambyses and Ochus, showed
great favor to the priests and placed native
Egyptians in posts of honor and command. He
made a journey into the desert, a most difficult,
hazardous and dangerous expedition, to visit
the oracle of Amon, and caused himself to be
proclaimed son of the god, with a curious mingling
of faith in the oracle and deliberate adoption
of a policy which conduced to his own interest
as well as to those of the people whom he
had conquered. He founded the city of Alexandria,
which alone might have made famous any
single or ordinary man, in addition to all else
that he accomplished in his comparatively short
life. The old Naucrates yielded its trade to the
new city and the port of Canopus was closed,
while Alexandria grew in splendor, importance
and intellectual prestige and became one of the
renowned cities of the world.</p>

<p>Separation and the life of constant excitement
which he led may have lessened the hold of Roxane
upon Alexander’s affection and a sudden
passion for other women have overtaken him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
but it is more probable that motives of policy
dictated his subsequent course.</p>

<p>At Suza occurred what was called “the great
marriage of Europe and Asia.” Planned by
Alexander to celebrate his victories and perhaps
to hasten the return of peace and good-will. He
took to wife Statira, daughter of Darius, and
some authorities say, also Parysatis, daughter of
Ochus, brother of Darius and one of the last
Persian kings of Egypt. He coerced or persuaded
his officers to follow his example, and
not one but many marriages were then performed.</p>

<p>So intent was Alexander on his purpose that
he put a premium on such connections and promised
to pay the debts of those who would take
Persian wives. At this time Ptolemy, later king
of Egypt, was united to a certain princess Aatakama,
daughter of Artabanes, of whom we find
no further mention, suggesting that these enforced
unions were not lasting, and were perhaps
regarded by their principals as a mere spectacular
performance, or even a comedy. These nuptials
were celebrated with great magnificence the banqueting
hall was laid with tables for numberless
guests and was gorgeously decorated. Pillars of
gold and silver, set with jewels, upheld the awning
above, and nothing that Eastern luxury could
suggest was spared to embellish the feast. According
to the Persian custom a row of armchairs
was placed for the bridegrooms and one
beside each for the brides, who came in procession,
fair to look upon, in beautiful and shining
garments, enhanced by all the appliances of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
toilette, and took each her place beside her lord.</p>

<p>It was a marriage of fatal import to all concerned.
We can imagine the jealous passion
aroused in the breast of Roxane at the sight or
report of all this, doubtless in striking contrast
with her own simple nuptials, jeopardizing as it
did the right of succession which might be
claimed by her own children, yet unborn. Perchance
the new queen added fuel to the flame by
a haughty demeanor, a half-concealed or openly
expressed contempt for the barbarian chief’s
daughter who had preceded her. Be this as it
may, Roxane rested not till, with the aid of Perdiccas,
one of Alexander’s generals, she had her
put to death. The story goes that after Alexander
was dead she sent a forged letter to Statira,
either as coming from him or with purport
that he was still alive and got Queen Statira into
her power and caused both her and her sister,
perhaps the before-mentioned Parysatis, to be
murdered and their bodies thrown into a well
and covered with earth. Having thus disposed
of a hated rival, she rested in fancied security,
but her own destruction eventually avenged this
cruel deed.</p>

<p>The life of Alexander, lived too fast, and with
little regard perhaps either to the laws of health
or morality, came to a speedy close. He died
323 B. C. Either ignorant of or indifferent to
the approaching birth of a child of his own, he
is said to have left his kingdom to “the worthiest,”
or some say “the strongest”—the first a
person far to seek in the midst of such a grasping
blood-thirsty throng. Some months after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Alexander’s death Roxane bore a son, who was
named Alexander Aegus, and the infant, in conjunction
with Alexander’s natural brother Philip
Arridaeus, apparently a man of weak intellect,
were nominally kings, under the regency of Perdicas,
or Perdikkas, one of Alexander’s most
prominent generals. No such giant succeeded
the heroic figure, almost that of a demi-god,
whose life had just closed, and the conglomerate
kingdom which he had created fell into numerous
fragments or divisions.</p>

<p>Roxane evidently could play the part of a Margaret
of Anjou and her subsequent history is but
a pitiful tale. She and her son fell into the
power of the generals, who, like vultures, settled
upon their prey. No noble emotion of protecting
the helpless stirred in their breasts. It was a
period of the world’s history in which weakness
courted its own destruction. “Might was right,”
a theory not altogether known in modern times,
was the general rule of existence and some years
after Alexander’s death Roxane and the young
Alexander were put out of the way to make room
for the grasp of stronger hands than those of a
woman and child.</p>

<p>At first the spoilers called themselves Satraps,
but eventually claimed or accepted the title of
king. Ptolemy took Egypt; Seleucus, Babylon
and Syria; Antigonus, Asia Minor, and Antipater,
Macedon, later conquered by descendants
of Antigonus; Lysimachus took Thrace; Leonatus,
Phrygia; and Eumenes, Cappadocia.</p>

<p>Alexander Aegus, like Caesarion, son of Cleopatra
VI of Egypt, was never allowed to succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
his father, but his life was cut short in youth.
Mother and child were simply used as pawns on
the great chess board of kings and when their
existence interfered with the designs of those in
power they were disposed of. The then known
world was in a tumult, war was the order of the
times, peace almost unknown. The uprising and
overthrow of one power and of one individual
after another was continuous, the pages of history
were stained with the blood, alike of the
guilty and the innocent.</p>

<p>The years succeeding the death of Alexander
must have been ones of anxiety, if not of absolute
terror to Roxane, and the possibility of a violent
death for herself and her child could not
but have suggested itself to her. Nominally wife
and mother of a king, she enjoyed little of the
pleasures of state, but was hurried here and
there and from camp to camp with scant ceremony.
A possession too valuable to those who
held her to let her go and in the end too valuable
to keep.</p>

<p>The disposal of Alexander’s body was a matter
of dispute. A counsel of officers decreed that
it should be buried in the Oasis of Amon, where
Alexander had been adopted by the god; Perdikhas
wished that it should be laid with the ancient
Macedonian kings, while Ptolemy was determined
that it should rest in Alexandria, the new
city. Ptolemy triumphed and the sarcophagus of
gold remained there for some time; we do not
know how long. Diodorus says “a coffin of
beaten gold was provided, so wrought by the
hammer as to answer the proportion of the body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
It was half filled with aromatic spices, which
served as well to delight the senses as to preserve
the body from putrefaction. Over the coffin
was a cover of gold, so exactly fitted as to answer
the higher part every way. Over this was thrown
a curious purple coat, near to which were placed
the arms of the deceased, that the whole might
represent the acts of his life.” This was placed
on a magnificent chariot adorned with figures,
symbolic designs, arches, floral designs in gold
and funerary urns, an absorbing spectacle to the
people. It seems almost strange that so much
honor was paid to the body of Alexander, so
little to his very flesh and blood.</p>

<p>This settlement of the place of burial brought
on a conflict with the regent who came to Egypt,
bringing King Philip and his wife Euridike and
Alexander IV and his mother Roxane, perhaps
her first visit to a land where she had been nominally
queen. Perdikhas acted in his treatment
of soldiers and enemies with great cruelty, Ptolemy
with a marked clemency, and the cavalry of
the former rose up and murdered him. Ptolemy
was then offered the regency and the charge of
the royal princes. But he was a cautious and
far-seeing man and content with what he had
already secured—the mastership of Egypt—firmly
declined so dangerous a responsibility. The
regency was then conferred upon or seized by
Antipator, and new distributions and divisions of
ownership ensued.</p>

<p>A mother and sister of Alexander, Olympias
and Cleopatra, had raised a faction against Antipator
and divided the government between them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
A firm believer in “women’s rights” were these
ancient and warlike dames; rights in which there
should be no distinction of sex, yet as ever the
weaker went to the wall. Cleopatra, it is said,
lived a royal widow at Sardis, wooed by all the
world—a woman doubtless of beauty, as she
showed herself of vigor and capacity. She would
have married Perdikhas or Leonatus, who had
died, but spurned the rest. Like England’s Queen
Elizabeth, she had many suitors. At last to
escape Antigonas she agreed to marry Ptolemy,
and thereby secured her own destruction, for
Antigonas could not contemplate a union which
might prove so injurious to himself and had her
secretly murdered. Some one seems always to
have stood ready for the commission of such
deadly crimes. But to throw dust in the eyes
of the people Antigonas gave her a magnificent
funeral and proceeded against the woman who
had been instrumental in her murder.</p>

<p>Time passed on and Antipater was succeeded
by his son Cassander, more ruthless, cruel and
self-seeking, if possible, than his predecessor,
and he determined to rid himself of a charge
become useless to him and assume full regal
power. Olympias had meanwhile secured the
death of Philip Arridaeus and his wife and carried
off the young king and his mother to Pydna.
Cassander besieged and took them, and Olympias
was cited to appear before a public assembly of
the Macedonians and answer for the murders she
had committed. Trusting in her own power and
influence she haughtily complied, but was condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
to death and secretly executed by the
relatives of those she had injured.</p>

<p>The young king and his mother were shut up
in the castle of Amphipolis, where they were
treated rather as captives than as royal personages,
and finally put to death. It seems almost
strange that Roxane, still young and probably
beautiful, was not forcibly married by one of
the contestants, and the question settled in this
way rather than by such tragic means, but it was
not to be, and the son of Alexander must needs
die or others could not grasp the power which
should have descended to him.</p>

<p>Ptolemy, if not directly accessory, at least connived
at this murder, and thus secured himself
in his new kingdom. It is said that the restoration
of the outward shrine of the great temple at
Luxor, built by Thothmes III and ruined by the
Persians, took place during the nominal sovereignty
of Philip Arridaeus and Alexander IV,
and therefore quite early in Ptolemy’s satrapy.
This restoration of the inner cella was in the
name of the boy king Alexander. A statue of the
young king is in the Gizeh Museum. It is of
granite and about nine feet in height. The gentle
and melancholy expression seems well suited to
the youth’s tragic fate, but he is represented as
much older than when he died, and it is probably
a conventional likeness, with a mingling of the
Egyptian and Greek in type and attributes. A
certain inscription in Egypt mentions Ptolemy in
the seventh year of the absent Alexander. His
destroyer kept up the fiction of his authority, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Ptolemy granted lands in the name of Alexander
and Philip after their decease.</p>

<p>We can almost imagine the unfortunate Queen
Roxane ready to lay down her harassed and
weary life, but such is the natural clinging to the
known and visible that doubtless she had occasional
periods of pleasure and even of reviving
hope for her child and herself. She had committed
or been accessory to the blackest crime
to secure his succession. Surely it could not be
in vain?</p>

<p>Alexander the Great was born in 355 B. C.
and died in 323. His son Alexander IV was
born 323 B. C. and died 310, but his name appears
as king till 305. Thus all the family of
Alexander the Great perished by violent deaths.
First his mother, then his wife and child, and
lastly in 309 B. C. his sister and his natural
son Herakles or Hercules.</p>

<span class="smaller">PTOLEMY QUEENS.</span></h2>

<p>In the study of the Ptolemy period, compared
with the dates of earlier times, we seem to come
so much nearer to the modern era that we might
look for certain knowledge. The more, as we
now have the histories of early writers, such
as Polybius, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, etc., to
consult, as well as the coinage, with dates and
portraits of kings and queens, to assist us. But
the historical account is frequently at second
hand and not as to matters which the writer has
himself seen and known, and even some of the
coins are found to be ambiguous and referable
to different reigns. The relationships, too, are so
mixed and the same names so often repeated that
at many points we are baffled in our search, and
various parts of this complex history remain in
darkness, which further investigation may yet
lighten, but which at present give room for the
conflicting theories and opinions of different
writers.</p>

<p>The chronology of Egypt, as before said, has
always been a subject of difficulty to students,
and their researches lead many to different conclusions.
Even in the time of the Ptolemies,
which seems modern compared to the periods we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
have been considering, the same problem confronts
us, and the fact that the Olympian and
the Julian year do not coincide makes exact
chronology impossible. Constant discoveries are
adding new light, and often in this and other respects
proving earlier conclusions incorrect. Thus
even in the Ptolemy period we do but approximate
to some of the dates, etc.</p>

<p>The testimony of the coins is of extreme value,
and we feel that like hard facts they never lie,
yet it is difficult to draw the line between the
conventional and the real likeness and between a
flattering and an unflattering presentment. The
portraits of the queens, celebrated in their own
times and in succeeding ages as miracles of beauty
and charm, sometimes strikes us with amazement
so utterly devoid do they seem of either.
We have to recall the possible potency of coloring
and animation, the fascination of manner and
of voice to rehabilitate them, reflecting how sometimes
even in the modern photograph, for which
it is said “the sun cannot lie,” the plain woman
sometimes appears beautiful and the beauty almost
plain.</p>

<p>As a rule the women of the Ptolemy family
seem to have been handsome, ambitious, capable,
daring and cruel, and, save in the cases of the
three first kings, were in many instances superior
to their husbands. They shared with husbands
and brothers the desire to keep the reins
of power in their own hands, and the willingness
to do away with those who stood in their path.
Murder and assassination were but the means to
an end and daunted but few of them. Yet here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
and there we come across an incident or an
anecdote which throws a softer light upon their
history, a touch of amiability or kindness, which
reveals “the eternal feminine” still latent in their
hearts.</p>

<p>The long line of Arsinoes, Berenikes and Cleopatras
is like a tangled skein of many colors and
most difficult to disentangle and render distinct.
Mother, daughter and sister perhaps bear the
same appellation, and one is reminded of the English
fashion of using the same or very similar
names for a whole region, as Highbury, Highbury
Hill, Highbury Crescent, etc., till the stranger
is fairly bewildered.</p>

<p>In the division of the vast landed possessions
of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy, son of Lagos
and Arsinoe, chose Egypt for his share and
founded a new line of kings. He was one of Alexander’s
generals and allied to him by blood, some
say the natural son of his father Philip.</p>

<p>It is probably the eagle on the Ptolemy coins
that suggested the fable or tradition that the first
Ptolemy was cared for by an eagle, as Romulus
and Remus by a wolf. Mahaffy, one of the
later and most reliable authorities on the Egypt
of this period, says that Ptolemy was, it is probable,
born 367 B. C., and hence was some years
older than Alexander, but still young enough to
be associated with him, and accompanied him into
exile, returning to court on his accession.</p>

<p>Whether he went with Alexander to Egypt is
not positively known, but it seems likely that
some personal acquaintance with and admiration
for that country dictated his choice. It may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
said to have been a love match between Ptolemy
and the land of his adoption, which could hardly
have been the case had he never seen it. Virtually
he threw himself into the arms of this new
mistress, who received him with no less enthusiasm,
stiff-necked rebel as she had been against
Persian rule. He and his successors, especially
the earlier ones, embraced the Egyptian theology,
built temples to the gods, accepted the manners
and customs of the people and affiliated themselves
with them in every way.</p>

<p>They married their nearest relatives in Egyptian
fashion and even surpassed their predecessors
in the dubious nature of these unions. Alternately
they seem to have adored the women
whom they selected as partners, to whom they
paid special honors, having their portraits
stamped upon the coins (up to this time gold
rings had been used as a medium of exchange)
and naming various cities after them or to have
quarrelled with and even murdered them.</p>

<p>To the massive dignity of design in the Egyptian
architecture the Ptolemies added something
of the Greek ideal, and the temples erected in
their time are among the most beautiful in the
land.</p>

<p>The seat of power and government changed
from time to time. First Memphis, the “City of
the Good”; the “White Walled,” founded by
Menes, with its great temple of Ptah, which dominated
it like a fortress. Next “Hundred-gated
Thebes,” the “City of Amon”; then Sais, situated
on a hill, with a royal citadel and storied and
painted houses. Tanis, recreated from an earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
settlement and stamped with his signet, his giant
statue, eighty or a hundred feet in height by
Rameses the Great—all these in turn were sovereign
in the land and the dwelling places of the
queens. Now under Ptolemies, Alexandria, one
of the masterpieces of the great Macedonian, rose
into prominence, vieing with Athens as a seat of
learning and the scene of unrivaled splendor,
magnificence and debauchery.</p>

<p>Deinocrates, the gifted architect of Alexander,
created a city of noble proportions, and inaugurated
a new style of architecture, happily combining
the values of the Oriental and the Greek.
The so-called “Pompey’s pillar” is the only one
remaining of the forest of columns which formed
part of the Greek temple of Serapis, the platform
on the top reached by a hundred steps, and the
walls incrusted with metals and jewels. It stood
high above the city, which was regularly laid out,
with streets cutting each other at right angles,
and bordered with colonnades. Among the other
noted buildings of which nothing now remains,
were the Mausoleum of Alexander, the harbor
works uniting the city and island of Pharos, the
temple of Pan, and that built by Ptolemy II, on
the outside of one of the city gates, to celebrate
the Elusinian mysteries, the aqueduct and
others, of which no trace remains, but of whose
existence we learn from early writers. The present
Rue de Rosette is said to follow the course
of the ancient main street, which crossed the city
from the east to the west gates. The paintings
still seen on the walls of Pompeii give us an idea
of the decorations of Alexandrine architecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>The great museum was a combination of university,
club and social gathering place. The
early Ptolemies, especially, were patrons of learning,
and people of all nations met at their brilliant
court, and thus it is said “arose in Egypt
the Neo-Greek culture which we are accustomed
to call Hellenism.” Literature, science and sculpture
flourished, and painting took on new forms
and woke to new life. The beautiful head of
Alexander in the British Museum and many other
fine examples of sculpture have come down to us
from this period.</p>

<p>The goldsmith’s work was also a fashionable
art and as Louis XVI of France amused himself
by being a locksmith—and how differently
might life have ended for him had Nature made
him of that class—Ptolemy II amused himself
by being a goldsmith.</p>

<p>For several years Ptolemy Sotor I, of the
House of Diodachi, reigned as nominal satrap or
governor. He then assumed the title of king, which
he bore for twenty-three years, dying at the advanced
age of eighty-four. His administration
was beneficial to the country, and he attached the
people to him by kindness and clemency, in
marked contrast to his Persian predecessors. He
had not hesitated to secure his throne by permitting
the murder of the young king, but showed
himself, in general, less cruel and blood-thirsty
than many of his contemporaries. He established
wise regulations, encouraged literature and art,
and brought captive Jews to people Alexandria.
His title of Sotor or Saviour was derived from
the assistance he lent the people of Rhodes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
against their enemies. Though brought up to a
military life and often engaged in war he evidently
did not love it for its own sake, and was
not the dashing soldier, but where diplomacy and
cautious measures would serve his purpose, preferred
to employ them.</p>

<p>The only portrait of Ptolemy Sotor is on the
coins, coinage being introduced into Egypt under
the Ptolemies. Here he appears, like other members
of the family with a full, rounded face, a
forehead not high but fleshy over the eyes, arched
brows, a nose rather too short and with wide nostrils,
a firm mouth and a prominent chin. Not so
handsome as Alexander, the Ptolemies, especially
the earlier ones, must yet have had considerable
claim to good looks.</p>

<p>The cartouches of Ptolemy I are uncertain and
not familiarly known, while those of Ptolemy
XIV and XV had not up to a very recent date
been found.</p>

<p>What is called the throne names of the Ptolemies
were as follows: Ptolemy Sotor, Arsinoe
III, and Philip Arridaeus had the same pre-nomen
“chosen of Ra, beloved of Ra.”</p>

<p>Arsinoe IV “Joy of the heart of Amen, chosen
of Ra, living image of Amen.” Ptolemy III and
his wife were spoken of as “Fraternal gods,
chosen of Ra, living image of Amen.”</p>

<p>Ptolemy IV was spoken of as “heir of the
beneficent gods, chosen of Ptah, strength of the
Ka of Ra, living image of Amen.”</p>

<p>Ptolemy VII as “heir of the (two) manifest
gods, form of Ptah, chosen of Amen, doing the
rule of Ra.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Ptolemy IX, “heir of the (two) manifest gods,
chosen of Ptah, doing the rule of Amen, living
image of Ra.”</p>

<p>Ptolemy X, “heir of the beneficent god and of
the beneficent goddess, chosen of Ptah, doing
the rule of Ra, living image of Amen.”</p>

<p>Ptolemy XI one cartouch “heir of the (two)
beneficent gods, chosen of Ptah, doing the rule of
Amen, living image of Ra.”</p>

<p>A second cartouch reads “Ptolemy, called Alexander,
living forever, beloved of Ptah.” Ptolemy
XIII, “heir of the god that saves, chosen of
Ptah, doing the rule of Amen, living image of
Ra.”</p>

<p>Various amours are credited to Ptolemy I
which at this late date would be difficult to either
prove or disprove, among many with a bad record
he was not notably vicious. Three wives
might legally have claimed the title, but his
love was evidently given to the last and probably
the youngest. Doubtless at Alexander’s behest
he first took a Persian wife, the Princess Artakama,
the daughter of Artabasus. Only two of
these Persian wives are known to appear in later
history, Amestris, daughter of Oxyartes, and
probably a sister or half sister of Roxane, married
to Krateras and subsequently to Lysimachus,
and Apame, who married Seleukas and became
the ancestress of the Seleukid dynasty.</p>

<p>Ptolemy I married the Princess Artakama 330
B. C., which would make him, if born 367 B. C.,
thirty-seven years of age at his first marriage.
He again wedded Eurydike, daughter of Antipater,
nine years later, and Berenike, evidently his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
favorite wife, when he was fifty. All the ladies
were doubtless much his juniors. The Princess
Artakama could not properly be called queen,
since she passes out of Ptolemy’s life and history
before he assumed the title of king.</p>

<p>The marriage with Eurydike, the daughter of
Antipater, who had subsequently made himself
king of Macedon, may have been merely a matter
of policy and not dictated by any motives of affection.
Ptolemy’s subsequent action and marked
preference for Berenike seems to suggest this;
but that he lived with her as his legal wife and
acknowledged the children of both is matter of
history. Eurydike came with a retinue to Egypt,
in the style of a great princess. It seems to have
been after the death of her father and during the
reign of her brother Cassander, with whom
Ptolemy had formed an alliance and wished to
keep on peaceful terms, perhaps this very marriage
was a pledge of their friendship. We judge
Eurydike to have been of less fiery temper and
disposition than Roxane, since she seems to have
accepted a successor and rival with comparative
equanimity and apparently made no effort to get
rid of or destroy her. In her train came a grand
niece of Antipater, doubtless young and beautiful,
a widow with all the fascinations pertaining
to that class, which probably she did not hesitate
to use upon the middle-aged king. The situation
bears some resemblance to that of Catharine
of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, though less fatal in
its immediate results.</p>

<p>One writer has made Berenike daughter of
Lagos and therefore step-sister of Ptolemy, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Mahaffy says “it is likely he was misled by the
formula ‘wife and sister’ applied to Egyptian
queens as a mere title of honor and which was
probably used in many documents regarding the
present princess.” And since Sotor was one of
the few Ptolemies who did not marry his immediate
relatives, it is well he should have credit
therefor.</p>

<p>Both ladies appear to have been amiably disposed
and Berenike was evidently a strong character
as well, who maintained a life-long influence
over her husband and secured for herself
and her children the first place. She was more
strictly speaking the queen, since it was after this
last marriage that Ptolemy assumed the title, and
it was Berenike’s son who succeeded to the
throne, as did the son of Atossa; Eurydike had
children, a son Ptolemy Keraunos and others,
and several daughters, whose claims were all set
aside for those of the more favored Berenike. So
in 317 B. C. Ptolemy married his chosen princess
and gave her and her children the first
place. By her previous marriage Berenike already
had three children, a son, Magas, and two
daughters, Theoxena and Antigone. These three
Ptolemy seems to have accepted almost as his
own, using the princesses as the cards or dice
of the great games he was playing, as auxiliaries
in cementing his political alliances. In arranging
all these marriages we may infer that Berenike’s
opinions and wishes had weight and who
knows but she may have used her influence to induce
Ptolemy himself to assure the title of King
of Egypt. She would be neither the first nor the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
last wife who has endeavored to fire her husband
with ambition.</p>

<p>To anticipate somewhat, her son, Magas, became
King of Cyrene, and Theoxena was married
to Agathocles of Syracuse, who was an upstart
and adventurer, but clever and able and
making so much of himself and his opportunities
that he had to be reckoned with by the contesting
powers. “Antigone was married to Pyrrus;
Lysandra to Sassander’s son, Alexander; Lysandra
(probably a second of the name), to Agathocles,
son of Lysimachus of Thrace; Arsinoe
to Lysimachus himself; Eirene to Eunostos, king
of Soli in Cyprus, and ultimately in 287 B. C.,
even Ptolemais to Demetrius.” Thus Ptolemy
Sotor utilized his large family, consisting, it is
said, of twelve children, to serve his political
purposes.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Keraunos, the eldest son and rightful
heir of his father, beheld, with bitterness, himself
set aside in favor of his younger brother and
continued, during his stormy life, to be a thorn
in the side of the Ptolemy succession. Our line
of research is to follow the domestic histories
rather than the public acts of the king, already
made familiar by the pens of many able writers.</p>

<p>The first child of Sotor by his marriage with
Berenike was a daughter, later the well-known
Arsinoe II, queen of Egypt. The son Ptolemy
Philadelphus, who succeeded his father, was born
in 308 B. C. (on the island of Kos, a favorite retreat
from Alexandria) during one of the campaigns
of Ptolemy in the Aegean, whither Berenike
had accompanied her husband, either from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the affection between them which forbade separation,
or the desire on the queen’s part to keep
near the king that she might continue to use her
great influence, seeking to bend the course of
events as they arose, to her own purposes. She
might well have earned the title both of Berenike
the Ambitious, and Berenike the Successful,
but scarcely those of Berenike the Just or the
Generous. The virtues of self-sacrifice and generosity
were sometimes shown under the ancient
moral code, but consideration and Justice were
fruits of the Christian Dispensation.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Sotor did not marry young, but lived
to see his children grow up and to associate with
him, on the throne, his son Ptolemy, called Philadelphus,
son of Berenike, and for the last years
of his life seemed to have resigned the regal
power into his hands. So large a family, composed
of such diverse elements, would, even in
modern times, have been apt to have difficulties
as regards matters of inheritance, and it is little
to be wondered at perhaps that such was supremely
the case in this instance. But, during his lifetime,
the arrangements of Ptolemy Sotor seem
to have been accepted, in a great degree, and it
was not till after his death that a fierce conflict
broke out among the rival claimants.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Sotor is said to have eaten with the
poor and borrowed plate from the rich. The
use of gold, silver and copper coins had been
common in Phoenicia and other countries before
it was introduced into Egypt by the first Ptolemy,
but Poole says “the monograms and symbols indicating
mints are more constant and regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
in the coinage of the Ptolemies than in any other
series of Greek regal money.” The pictures of
the kings and queens on the coins, albeit frequently
conventionalized, assist us much in our
search for knowledge concerning them. The
regular silver coinage presents the heads of
kings and queens on one side, often those of the
gods, eagles, etc., on the other. The place of the
mint name was usually on the reverse side, and,
if dated, on opposite sides of the field. A rare
place for the mint name was between the legs
of the eagle. The gold coinage was often not
struck in the time of those whose heads it bears.
Thus Philadelphus honored both his parents after
their decease. Queen Berenike I appears on the
coins both alone and with her husband. The
face is dignified and beautiful, a straight Greek
nose and regular features. Of her death we find
no record, but she appears to have been loved and
honored by both husband and son, and whichever
survived her no doubt she was buried with all
possible respect.</p>

<p>Though many wars occurred during the reign
of Ptolemy Sotor, yet it was so long that he had
also much time to spare for the internal administration
and improvement of his kingdom, and
some writers believe that many things of benefit
thereto, attributed to Ptolemy Philadelphus
should really be credited, at least in their inception,
to Ptolemy Sotor. He built and added to
some of the finest temples, extended and adorned
Alexandria and is said to have written a history
of Alexander’s campaigns, which, unfortunately,
has been lost, and showed his appreciation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
mental attainments by surrounding himself with
men of learning and culture.</p>

<p>Queen Eurydike seems to have endured with
what grace she might the secondary place accorded
to her and her children, till the younger Ptolemy
was made king, when they all left Egypt, no
doubt in bitterness of soul and resolved if possible
to wrest from him, whom they regarded as
a usurper of his elder brother’s rights, his regal
powers.</p>

<p>The Ptolemies, called the Lagidae, were a
popular race. Ptolemy Sotor seems to have possessed
much suavity and personal charm of manner,
and the Egyptians and other conquered peoples
were treated by him and the earlier Ptolemies
with much more consideration and humanity
than by other more ruthless conquerors. Ptolemy
Sotor is said to have had at least twelve
children by different wives, as well as by the
courtezan Thais. Statues of him are mentioned
by various writers, but have not been found, and
his portrait on the coins is the only one that remains
to us. The three earliest members of the
family seem to have a stronger claim to good
looks than their successors, who, both in regularity
of outline and general expression, are distinctly
below the ancestral level.</p>

<p>Eurydike, though probably the elder, may have
survived her rival, but their part was now played
on the stage of history and they passed from the
scene, leaving it to a multitude of other actresses,
some of whom excelled them in beauty and celebrity,
while others remain to us but as a shadow
and a name.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_24">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">ARSINOE II.</span></h2>

<p>The most prominent figure in the long and involved
list of Ptolemy queens, next to that of the
famed Cleopatra, is Arsinoe II, daughter of Sotor
and Berenike, and sister and wife of Ptolemy
Philadelphus. She is spoken of on the Mendes
stele, now at Gizeh, as “the charming princess,
the most attractive, lovely and beautiful, the
crowned one, who has received the double diadem,
whose splendor fills the palace, the friend
of the sacred Ram and his priestess Uta Utaba,
the king’s sister and wife who loves him, the
queen Arsinoe.” And of no other queen do we
find so many monuments in various parts of the
Greek world.</p>

<p>To the day of Arsinoe’s death she seems to
have had the strongest hold upon her husband’s
affections and no token of honor and respect was
too great to lavish upon her while living, or to
eulogize her merits after her decease. The early
part of her life was a tragic story, but she survived
the cruel sorrows which might have killed
a woman of less toughness of fibre than that
which distinguished all the female members of the
Ptolemy race, and lived through a prosperous
and successful middle life, turning her back on
the bitterness of the past and making the most of
the honors and dignity which came to her in the
course of years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>In placing his younger son on the throne, instead
of the elder, who would usually have been
considered the rightful heir, Ptolemy Sotor may
have been influenced by the personal character of
the two, as well as by other motives. The elder
bore the name of Ptolemy Keraunos, a soubriquet
or nick-name meaning gloomy or violent,
and was “of fiery temper and unsteady life.”
Mahaffy suggests that the thunderbolt added to
the Ptolemy coins at the time of his birth possibly
gave rise to the nick-name. History does
not chronicle details, but there may have been
actual quarrels between father and son, a state
of affairs not unknown in modern times. Be
this as it may, the younger was preferred before
the elder. Neither succession perhaps could have
prevented subsequent bitterness of feeling and
strife. Yet peace was outwardly observed during
the life of the old king. Keraunos submitted
and left Egypt with his mother, brothers and
sister, while Berenike’s son was made king, co-ruler
with his father (who virtually abdicated in
285-4) with feasts and rejoicing.</p>

<p>Ptolemy the younger was “fair haired and
delicate” in youth, resembling his father, but with
more regular features, and the thick neck characteristic
of many members of the family. His
manners were gentle as well as popular and probably
he had already shown an appreciation of his
father’s policy and a taste for intellectual and
scientific pursuits. Few fathers would not take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
more pleasure in the succession of a son likely to
carry out their views, than in one who seemed
disposed to change and alter all their arrangements.</p>

<p>Gorgeous pageants celebrated the advent of the
new king. His father, it may be said, had in a
certain measure slipped into power; not so with
the son, his successor. It was a matter of direct
inheritance and in Egypt at least his claim was
not disputed. Whatever assistance Ptolemy Keraunos
secured was from foreign aid and not
from partizans at home. The banqueting hall
was decorated with sculpture and painted and carpeted
with flowers, the gold and silver vessels,
crown treasures, were carried in the grand procession.
There were fruits of all sorts displayed
and droves of camels, elephants and other wild
animals. Elephants were then much in favor as
battle chargers with the kings of this period, and
though the Ptolemies made less use of them in
this respect, they too had large numbers of them.
Their popularity, however, soon declined and in
later wars they were no longer deemed available.
Ptolemy Sotor presented the victors in the
games at his son’s coronation with twenty crowns,
Queen Berenike with twenty-three.</p>

<p>Historical and allegorical tableaux were interspersed
and eighty thousand troops of cavalry
and infantry took part. It must have been a combination
of the circus processions of modern
times, with less tinsel and more of solid value,
with a fine military parade. It delighted the people
from morning till evening and showed to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
strangers the wealth and power of the Ptolemy
House.</p>

<p>Spite of gentle seeming, as soon as his father’s
death left him in possession of the regal power,
the new king made it quite clear he would tolerate
no rival and meant to keep possession of all he
had gained. Like his father, perhaps, he had no
special taste for the shedding of blood; indeed he
is said to have deplored what he considered the
necessity of pursuing this policy, none the less
did he hesitate to do so to secure his throne, and
several people were put to death whom he
thought might give him trouble. Probably his
elder brother would have been among these could
he have laid his hand on him. It was mortal
strife between them, and Ptolemy Keraunos was
now in another country doing his best to unseat
the young king.</p>

<p>Some years before her brother’s accession the
young Arsinoe, a girl of sixteen, first child of
Ptolemy Sotor and Berenike, had married, or
rather been married, to the elderly Lysimachus,
King of Thrace (disparity of years was of course
of no account in a political marriage), and had
exchanged her sunny Egyptian home for the
cooler and more rigorous climate of the mountainous
regions of Northern Greece. Beautiful,
clever and ambitious, as were most of the Ptolemy
women, she was prominent among them and
destined to have strong influence wherever she
went, especially over two at least of the men with
whom she was most closely associated. This
marriage took place about 300 B. C.</p>

<p>So anxious was Ptolemy Sotor to cement the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
alliance between Lysimachus and himself, that
marriage after marriage was arranged for and it
might have been supposed that the two families
were so closely united that peace among them had
been secured. His step-daughter Lysandra was
given to the Thracian Crown Prince Agathocles,
thus making her at the same time sister and
daughter-in-law of Arsinoe, who was probably
the younger of the two, and not content with
this, a marriage was arranged between the young
king of Egypt and Arsinoe, daughter of Lysimachus,
and half-sister of Agathocles, who thus
became Queen Arsinoe I of Egypt.</p>

<p>She, too, was a person of spirit, decision and
character, bloodshed marked her footsteps; she
caused an illicit lover of her mother’s to be slain,
and is said herself, young though she was, to have
hastened on her marriage with the Egyptian king.
One of policy rather than affection probably on
both sides. It requires a clear head to follow out
these complicated relationships. Arsinoe I had
attained her ambition, but it was a position, in
those unsettled times, involving quite as much
peril as honor. She became the mother of several
children, but whether her life was a happy
one we may justly have our doubts. It held, however,
less tragedy than that of her successor. Perhaps
she was neither beautiful nor winning, certain
it is that the courtesies which were subsequently
paid to various queens, of putting their
likeness on the coins and naming cities after them,
were omitted in her case.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Philadelphus founded, it is said, four
Berenikes in honor of his mother, eighteen Arsinoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
in honor of his second wife, and three Philoteras,
in honor of his sister, in Egypt and elsewhere.
These last were out of regard to a favorite
sister Philotera, who dwelt in single blessedness—shall
we call it a rare privilege in those
days?—and lived in great harmony with her
brother and his queens. As to the queen, Arsinoe
II, so to the maiden sister also poems were
addressed by the versifiers of the times.</p>

<p>The Thracian Arsinoe I, notwithstanding her
early self-assertion, seems to have made little
mark either upon her husband or upon Egypt.
The comparative neglect with which she was
treated may have embittered her and made true
the accusation brought against her of having conspired
against the life of her husband. If it was
true she was leniently dealt with. She was divorced
about 277 B. C. in the eighth or ninth year
of Ptolemy’s reign, and banished to Koptos,
where she lived in some state and appears from
certain records to have been accompanied or
visited by her younger son. She kept up her intercourse,
too, perhaps with some of her Thracian
relatives; and built shrines to the gods. The
very fact that her life did not pay the forfeit of
her alleged crime seems to throw doubt upon it.
Or possibly, though this seems less likely, Arsinoe
II, her supplanter, who in general, her purpose
accomplished, showed no desire for the shedding
of blood, may have induced the king to
spare her. We can only surmise.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Philadelphus was a prosperous and
popular king; living in comparative peace in
sunny Egypt with his Thracian wife, remote from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
most of the wars which were carried on in his
name and caring little what battles raged at a distance
so that he preserved himself and his kingdom
in relative quiet. There were wars and rebellions
afar, there were times even when Egypt
itself was threatened, but through it all, at home,
Ptolemy was able to pursue a relatively peaceful
way. He spent his time adorning his splendid
city and enlarging and, so to call it, emphasizing
the scope of his great museum, a combination of
university, club and social gathering place. The
early Ptolemies, especially, were patrons of learning
and people of all nations met at their brilliant
court. He gathered around him men of intellectual
and scientific pursuits and enjoyed mental
pleasures as well as those of a lower order.
His courtiers lavished upon him unstinted adulation
and he might well have walked the earth as
proudly as the great Rameses II, his predecessor.</p>

<p>It is to him we owe the translation of the Bible
called the Septuagent, from the seventy translators
who were gathered together to accomplish
the task. Manetho, of Sebennytus, a priest of
Heliopolis, was also employed by the king to collect
the fragments of Egyptian history, from the
time of Menes 4455 B. C. to 322 B. C. which had
lain hidden or neglected in the various temples,
and prepare from them a consecutive narrative.
But unfortunately only fragments of this also
now remain to us, and it is from these, given by
Josephus and other Jewish and Christian writers
that we have obtained our earliest knowledge, in
a literary form, of Egyptian history. This work
enjoyed a high reputation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>The king himself must have had some literary
ability, or at least a pretty turn for the use of
the pen, for he wrote a history of Alexander’s
conquests. That it was much celebrated and
lauded goes without saying; even in modern times
the literary productions of king or president are
much in demand and widely read. But of its
intrinsic merits we are unable to judge, since it
too is lost to us, an unfortunate fact, as it could
not fail to have been of interest, whatever its
method of treatment or literary value.</p>

<p>Ptolemy made wise laws and so far as he
could, combined with his own personal advantage,
wrought in every way for the internal improvement
of his kingdom. Notwithstanding the modern
assertions of liberty, equality and fraternity,
it may be doubted whether in all ages and at all
times man is not more or less a slave to circumstance
and environment, but certainly the slaves
of the early Ptolemies might have contrasted favorably
both with those that who came before and
those who came after. Less trampled upon and
oppressed than in the reigns of the Pyramid
builders, the great Rameses, or the Persian line,
they appear also to have been better off and more
peaceful than under the later Ptolemy rulers.</p>

<p>Ptolemy, ably seconded by his favorite wife,
was devoted to the service of the temples and
favorable to the priests, a policy which helped to
strengthen his place and power. He built and
restored temples both to the gods of Greece and
Egypt. These last were approached in solemn
procession, and were not merely, like the Greeks,
to hold images of the gods, or like the later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Christian places of worship to accommodate a
congregation. They had a holy of holies, into
which only the high priest entered. Through the
avenue of sphinxes, which frequently gave entrance
to the temples, the long line would wind
from their gaily decorated boats on the Nile,
while the sacred lakes and the sacred grove were
generally within the enclosure. The pylons or
entrances were most imposing and an open court
and a great hall beyond, with colonnades and
columns, adorned with sculpture and paintings,
gave entrance to this highest sanctuary, containing
the symbol of the god or sacred animal.</p>

<p>No traces remain of the temple building of
Ptolemy Philadelphus beyond the beautiful island
of Philae; but at many other points ruins and
fragments are to be found. Those of the temple
of Isis in Hebt are near the present Mausura.
These are of red and grey granite, with columns
and architraves. There are figures of the king
making offerings to Isis and among others an
inscription which reads “Isis, Mistress of Hebit,
who lays everything before her royal brother.”
Of the portrait statues of the Egyptian kings and
queens Dr. Lepsius says: “They wear the same
character of monumental repose as the gods
themselves and yet without the possibility of their
human individuality being confounded with the
universally typical features of the divine images.”</p>

<p>But intellectual, or so called religious pursuits,
not alone shared Ptolemy’s heart and attention.
His was a pleasure-loving nature; beautiful women
thronged his court, sought his favor and
beamed upon him with smiles and blandishments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
No claim of legal wife, not even the true and devoted
affection which he showed so plainly that
he felt for his latest spouse, prevented his indulging
in baser connections. He was the king—if
no other man—the king at least might do as he
pleased, there was none to criticise, none to prevent.
Then, too, he amused himself with his
goldsmith’s work, bench and tools doubtless occupied
some favorite nook in the palace, and since
this fancy is matter of record, we may judge that
he turned out some creditable specimens of work,
was no mean craftsman and perhaps adorned
with his own skill the favorite of the hour, or the
plumb and beautiful form of his beloved Arsinoe
II.</p>

<p>To the personal history of this same princess,
the subject of the present sketch, we turn once
more. Like Roxane, wife of Alexander, she in a
measure deserved and prepared the way for her
own subsequent misfortunes. She was queen of
Thrace, a distinguished and honorable position,
but obtained at the cost of the honor, feelings and
probably affections of the previous queen. Lysimachus
had lived at Sardis, apparently in harmony
with a noble Persian wife, Amestris. But,
probably for political reasons alone, he sent her
away, and married the young daughter of Ptolemy
Sotor.</p>

<p>The new queen of Thrace resembled her
mother Berenike in her ambition and tact. She,
too, acquired great influence over an old husband,
as far as in her lay, ousted her step-children from
their natural rights, and secured all she could for
her own. She obtained from the king the session<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
of several valuable towns, but was not contented.
Again like her mother before her she
wished to supplant the elder members of the family.
At this crisis Ptolemy Keraunos, “the Embroiler,”
arrived at the Thracian court, and instead
of, as might have been expected, siding
with his own sister Lysandra, who had married
the Crown Prince, Agathocles, calumniated him
to the king, showing how completely the old
man was under Arsinoe’s powerful influence, and
succeeded in having the prince put to death.
None of which shows Arsinoe in a very amiable
light, but she doubtless thought one must fight
for one’s self, by whatever means, or be driven to
the wall.</p>

<p>There were other allies, Magas, King of Cyrene
and half brother of Ptolemy Keraunos,
seems to have leaned to his side, in the contest
which the latter was waging for his rights, and
been ready to throw off the yoke of Egypt. These
were stirring times, men and women too, whether
they would or not must lead “the strenuous life.”
Seleukos, King of Syria, lent aid to Ptolemy
Keraunos, and attacked Lysimachus, who lost his
life in battle, but instead of proceeding further
to place Keraunos on the throne of Egypt, as
the latter expected, he suddenly determined to go
back to his old home in Macedonia. Disappointed
and enraged, Keraunos secured the murder of
Seleukos and proclaimed himself king in his
place. That he could have succeeded in this
gigantic scheme, Mahaffy considers, shows him
to have had many fellow conspirators.</p>

<p>His Egyptian projects had now to be abandoned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
as Antiochus, son of Seleukos, was already
hastening to avenge the death of his
father. So Keraunos, nothing loth probably,
seized upon the throne of Thrace, the king and
his eldest son both being dead. Grabbing a Kingdom
seems to have been comparatively easy—the
pastime of adventurers in those days—but
it was frequently “light come and light go”—there
was seldom any real stability in these self-made
royalties.</p>

<p>Again Arsinoe, the Egyptian born, appears in
an unfavorable light (though how far independence
of action or any other course was possible
to her we cannot judge) for she married this
murderer of kings, the son of her father’s first
wife. Doubtless she must have foreseen the possibility
of ill consequences, for she was a woman
of acute mind, but probably in the midst of such
troublous times and so many perplexities it
seemed the safest thing to her to marry the
strongest, the man who had proved himself a
success, and she believed that it would secure
her and her children the throne of Thrace. She
had already lent herself to cruel deeds to secure
this object, she must needs go on in the same
path. Few more unlovely characters than Keraunos
appear in this dark period of history. It
is evident that he simply married Arsinoe to get
her in his power, for no sooner had he done so
than he murdered her young children and banished
her childless and heart-broken to the island
of Samothrace, to repent in bitterness of
soul her sad mistake. Two years later the
monster was overthrown in battle, dragged from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
his elephant, and hacked to pieces by the barbarous
Gauls, leaving, we may imagine, but few
to mourn his well-deserved fate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the childless widow, stripped of
throne, honors and kindred abode in the holy,
isle. To her perhaps life seemed ended, little
foreseeing the splendid future before her. Turning
to religious consolations in time of sorrow,
she worshipped the strange divinities of the place,
building shrines to them, of which traces have
been discovered in modern times, and even adding
them to the long list of Egyptian divinities
and building temples to them when she returned
to her native land.</p>

<p>Deeply attached to her as he proved himself
to be later, we cannot suppose Ptolemy Philadelphus
to have been unmoved by the great misfortunes
of his sister, but news traveled slowly in
those days, and whatever the cause, he seems to
have done nothing at once to avenge her losses.
Whether at his instance or hers we know not, but
after a certain length of time Arsinoe returned
to Egypt. She took new hold of life and perhaps
even began to scheme for the attainment
of the honors which she shortly won. Recognized
or not, her presence was a menace to the
reigning queen. Equally it remains possible that
she was innocent in this matter, further than
acquiescence in the wishes of the king, but her
previous course in Thrace lends color to the
former idea.</p>

<p>So Arsinoe I was banished and Ptolemy married
the widow, who now became Arsinoe II,
called Philadelphus during her lifetime, and only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
subsequently was the title bestowed upon her
husband to distinguish him among the long list
of Ptolemy kings. This strange marriage was
quite in accordance with Egyptian customs,
where the queen was frequently called the king’s
sister, as a term of honor, whether she was so
or not, and shows how the Ptolemies had accepted
Egyptian ideas, which no doubt largely
account for their popularity. But to the Greeks
such unions were an offence and deemed, as we
would in a Christian age, incestuous. But the
king was absolute, one of the courtiers, if not
more, who dared to criticise and disapprove, paid
with life for his temerity.</p>

<p>The first marriage occurred probably when
Arsinoe II was about sixteen, her third and last
when she was thirty-nine or forty. There can
be little doubt that she had beauty and charm,
a vigorous mind and great tact. She needed
scope for her powers and in becoming queen of
Egypt found a field well suited to her desires
and abilities. We seem to see some resemblance
between her and Queen Mertytefs of ancient
times. Both were in succession wife to different
kings, both were women of great attractiveness
and capacity, and both took a personal share in
public affairs. Step by step the new queen rose
to greater prominence. Her sorrows were of
the past, now life was all sunshine. She attained
the highest point to which mortal could
reach, she was finally worshipped as a goddess,
and on a certain stele found at Pithon, she is
even represented as a deity bestowing favors on
her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>In the fifteenth year of Ptolemy’s reign Arsinoe
II was made goddess of Mende, in the nineteenth
at Thebes and in the twentieth or twenty-first,
as Isis-Arsinoe, she was worshipped at Sais,
and the king claimed these honors for her in all
the temples of Egypt. There had been a city,
the centre of the Egyptian worship of the crocodile,
this Ptolemy re-named after the queen; it
was enlarged, embellished and Hellenised to a
great extent by the introduction of the Greek
language and the erection of temples to the
Greek gods and institutions on a Greek pattern.
Its population at one time was said to amount
to a hundred thousand.</p>

<p>Among other attractions for the king, perhaps,
was also the fact that Arsinoe was a great heiress.
She had proprietary claims on Cassandrea, Pontiac,
Heraclia and its dependent cities, bestowed
on her by her first husband. In the region called
the Fayum, the former Lake Moeris was drained
and turned into a fertile plain and this work was
attributed to Arsinoe and it was now called the
Arsinoe nome, and from it the queen derived part
of her revenues. Old records show that it was
settled by veteran soldiers who brought wives
from Greek lands, and that it was an orderly
and well managed society, with few crimes laid to
its account.</p>

<p>Arsinoe II was an ideal stepmother, in the
better sense of the word. The children of Ptolemy
were treated by her as her own—only one
son appears to have accompanied his mother into
exile, if even he remained permanently with her—all
the others dwelt in apparent harmony and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
affection with her supplanter. Thus Ptolemy
Philadelphus had an intellectual companion
whose advice he sought and upon whose judgment
he relied, whose personal charms were
great, who made life smooth and agreeable and
who dwelt at peace both with his favorite sister
and his children. While last, and perhaps not
least in her catalogue of virtues in his eyes, she
was lenient to his defections from the moral code
and saved him from the desire and peril of other
alliances. Such as she was the king seems to
have idolized her and paid her every possible
honor in life and in death. That she was some
years his senior in no way interfered with a marriage
apparently most congenial to both.</p>

<p>Deprived first of parents, then of husband,
children and throne Arsinoe had a strange and
rare experience, virtually a second life lay before
her, surpassing in all respects her earlier
career. She dwelt in light and airy palaces built
of brick and wood, richly decorated with color,
adorned with balconies and surrounded by gardens
and ponds. The music of tambourine, drum
and flute, violin with one string, zither, lute or
mandolin—and song and chorus, she had but to
speak her pleasure and silence became melodious.
Rhythm but not time, and monotonous singing
through the nose, not pleasing to the European
ear, is said to describe Egyptian music of to-day
and probably that of the past also, but it was
doubtless to their taste. The queen, too, had the
privilege of being priestess in the temples and
playing the sacred sistrum before the gods. She
dwelt in an increasingly beautiful city, with wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
streets, splendid palaces and many fine buildings.</p>

<p>Her associations were with men of culture and
learning. She was surrounded by courtiers and
poets who paid her homage and wrote in her
praise. Doubtless, too, through her many tried
to obtain favors from and influence with the
king. She was for those times a deeply religious
woman, building temples to the gods and lavishing
gifts upon them. Thereby, of course, she
endeared herself to the priests, always a more or
less influential class, and it was probably owing
to this, in addition to her husband’s partiality,
that she was, even during her lifetime, deified.
Both she and the king, we may judge, had affable
and agreeable manners and both seem to
have been very popular with the people.</p>

<p>In all the concerns of the kingdom she took
an active share, and it is said that “no queen till
we reach the last Cleopatra ever wielded greater
political influence.” Wars and rumors of wars
there were, but Egypt itself in this reign rested
in comparative peace. The queen’s life must
have been busy and full of interest, thus enabling
her to recover from her earlier sorrows. Egypt
was a country flowing not with milk and honey,
but with oil and wine, the juices of the olive and
the grape, from which large revenues were derived.
As the great museum is said to have
formed part of the palace, and contained cloisters
or porticoes, a public theatre, or lecture room,
and an immense dining hall, where the learned
feasted together, it is possible that the queen
may have been no unfamiliar figure within its
walls. The person of the Ptolemy queens was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
doubtless as well known to the people as the
wife of many a modern ruler, the Persian custom
of strict seclusion for women not obtaining
among the Greeks and their descendants.</p>

<p>There is a story told of Queen Arsinoe II, considered
reliable, to the effect that she took exception
to the ordering of a feast to one of the
gods, remarking “this is a shabby consorting together,
for the company must be a mixed crowd
of all sorts, the food stale and not decently
served,” and thereafter provided for better arrangements
at her own expense. Hitherto each
guest, somewhat in the manner of a modern country
picnic, having brought a miscellaneous and
disorderly collection. And whatever the queen
did in the matter was doubtless accepted by the
king.</p>

<p>Together with his sister, the royal pair travelled
through the country and cities were founded
bearing the name of both ladies. Together the
king and queen seem to have governed and
planned for the internal improvement of the kingdom,
studying its needs and necessities by personal
inspection. They made two visits to Pithon,
and their foreign officials brought back elephants
and various curiosities, to pleasure their
majesties, or by special command. Part of the
text of an ancient inscription found in the mounds
of the ruins of this very city reads: “He brought
all the things which are agreeable to the king,
and to his sister, his royal wife who loves him;”
further, “and he built a great city to the king with
the illustrious name of the king, the lord of
Egypt, Ptolemais. And he took possession of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
with the soldiers of his majesty and all the workmen
of Egypt and the land of Punt.” Also they
caught elephants and in another place it proceeds,
“and in this place (Kemuer-sea) the king
had founded a large city to his sister, with the
illustrious name of King Ptolemy (Philotera).”
The same beloved sister, to whom, as well as to
the queen herself, court poets, like Callimachus,
addressed poems. Sanctuaries were also built
there to the princess Adelphus.</p>

<p>The delicate and pleasure-loving king never
commanded his armies in person, but was quick
to take advantage of anything in his own favor.
He sent ambassadors to treat with the great and
growing power of Rome, and made alliances
wherever possible with any power strong enough
to do his harm. With Pyrrhus, king of Epirus,
he was connected by the marriage of a step-sister,
Antigone; his mother, Berenike’s daughter,
by her first husband.</p>

<p>Always beside the king, Arsinoe II was a
woman of affairs, busy and capable, but not too
much occupied to enjoy the amenities of life and
make it agreeable to her consort. In his foreign
wars and alliances, in the internal improvement
of the kingdom, in his literary work, the story
of Alexander’s campaigns, in Manetho’s History
of Egypt, in the translation of the Septuagent,
in the additions to the great library in
which at the time of his death Ptolemy Philadelphus
is said to have left 700,000 volumes, in the
marriages of his children we cannot doubt the
queen’s active interest and sympathetic share,
above all others she was the Privy Councillor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>At Karnak and various points along the Nile
as far as Philae, are fragments of temples both
to Egyptian and Greek gods, built or restored by
Ptolemy Philadelphus, and both he and his wife
were interested in the Cabeiri mysteries, probably
in their later years as some one has well
said, “to still the longings of the soul with spiritual
food and with dim revelations of the unseen,”
here, too, perhaps, we may see the queen’s
influence, since they were celebrated with special
solemnity at Samothrace, the home of her widowhood.
The king and queen lived in an atmosphere
of adulation, like that which surrounded
Louis XIV. Writers of the time drew flattering
pictures of them and coarse caricatures of the
masses. As to-day newspapers, whatever the
private convictions of their editors, will bow and
truckle to what they believe to be the popular
view of any subject, so in ancient times it was
the king and queen alone and those in high places
who thus swayed the pen.</p>

<p>Some writers believe that Ptolemy and Arsinoe
had one son who died in youth, but the
weight of testimony is against this. In regard to
the marriages of her step-children, whom she had
brought up as her own, we may well believe the
queen’s influence was great. The eldest daughter,
Berenike, the child of Arsinoe I, was married to
Antiochus II, the sickly king of Syria, chiefly
in the hope of establishing an Egyptian claim to
the throne of that monarchy. Sacrificed like so
many young princesses, both before and after,
to political purposes. Yet Ptolemy Philadelphus
seems to have regarded this daughter with especial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
tenderness, for he accompanied her to her
husband’s kingdom, was present at the marriage,
and continued to send her the water of the fertile,
beloved and worshipped Nile for use in
her distant home. To accomplish this marriage
Antiochus II had put away his first wife, Laodike.
But this last was not a woman to submit
meekly to such indignity, and stopped at nothing
to recover her lost position. Who did in those
days—even the best of them—hesitate at any
crime to secure her object? The injured queen,
burning to avenge her wrongs, caused the king
to be poisoned, he, perhaps weakly, having put
himself in her power by going to see her at
Ephesus, even after the birth of a son by the new
queen. Nor was this enough, for the death of
her rival was also determined upon, Laodike having
many adherents, and ere her father could
come to her rescue, poor Berenike and her babe
were also murdered, innocent victims of political
intrigue. Ptolemy Philadelphus perhaps
lived long enough to hear of this tragic death, but
not long enough to avenge it—a task he left to
the son who succeeded him.</p>

<p>Of the personality and general characteristics
of no queen in the long Ptolemy line can we
gather a clearer idea from the records that remain
to us. There is a statue of Ptolemy Philadelphus
and Arsinoe II in the Vatican, with, Mahaffy
thinks, the dear sister Philactera beside
them. Not only on coins, but among the effigies
at the entrance of the Odeum at Athens, where
the statues of the Egyptian kings were set up,
she had her place. Pausanius also saw at Helicon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
a statue of her “riding upon an ostrich in
bronze.” A position elevated, but lacking in dignity,
perhaps, like a grey-haired lady on the modern
bicycle. “It is very likely,” continues Mahaffy,
“that this statue or a replica was present
to the mind of Callicachus when he spake in the
‘Coma Berinices,’ of ‘the winged horse, brother
of the Aethiopian Memnon, who is the messenger
of Queen Arsinoe, she is also in that
poem called Venus and Zaphyrion.”</p>

<p>From the coins we learn of Arsinoe II that
there were octadrams in all metals with her
image, and those with portraits of Ptolemy I and
Berenike I, and those of Ptolemy II and herself;
and in silver of Ptolemy I, and also of her
alone, struck in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus;
also gold coins with Arsinoe II alone.
The coins of Arsinoe II were mainly octadrams
in gold and decadrams in silver. On these and
also on those of her step-daughter, Berenike II,
both queens are diademed and veiled, with regular
features, indisputably handsome but conventionalized.
Arsinoe II appears with the horn of
Zeus Amon, diadem, stephane or crown, veil and
sceptre. She is beautiful in youth and still handsome,
though more portly as depicted in later
years. Most of the Ptolemy queens grew comfortably
plump with time; the murder of a rival
or even the death of their nearest relatives appears
to have interfered little with their digestion.</p>

<p>But death earnest last to put an end to these
ceaseless activities, whether by slow decay or sudden
illness, we know not. Ptolemy Philadelphia
died 247 B. C., Arsinoe II, some say 270 B. C.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
but we have no precise date. The king was in
no sense a faithful lover, since he had a succession
of feminine favorites, alternating in the
company of philosophers and mistresses. Yet
he seems to have mourned Arsinoe with a passionate
grief, and indulged in what may be called
wild schemes to do her honor. One of these was
the building of a temple with a loadstone in the
roof which should hold, suspended in mid-air,
an iron statue of the queen. In everything he
had leaned upon her, and she had made life
agreeable to him, his sorrow for her loss was sincere
and deep. Her popularity with the people
was also widespread, more inscriptions in her
honor have been found all over Egypt than of
those of any of the succeeding queens.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Philadelphus reigned more than thirty-six
years and left his kingdom peacefully to his
son Euergetes, whose name had long been associated
with his in public acts.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_25">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE.<br />
<span class="smaller">PTOLEMY QUEENS (CONTINUED).</span></h2>

<p>Ptolemy Euergetes, the Benefactor, son of
Ptolemy Philadelphus and Arsinoe II, was the
third of his race to become king of Egypt. He
ascended the throne when past his early youth,
and appears to have remained unmarried until
this time. We know little of his early life, and
one writer suggests that the all-pervading power
and influence of his stepmother, Arsinoe II, may
have caused him to absent himself from his native
land, but this is merely hypothesis.</p>

<p>He chose for himself, or his father chose for
him, Berenike, daughter and heiress of Magas,
King of Cyrene, who at the time of their marriage
was reigning queen in her father’s stead,
the Egyptian prince having been declared Lord
of Cyrene, and on this marriage King Consort,
while she now became Berenike II of Egypt.
Magas was the son of Berenike I, the grandmother
of Euergetes by a marriage previous to
that with Ptolemy Sotor, hence there was a sort
of cousinship between Euergetes and his bride.
Personal acquaintance there may have been also,
and real affection, of which it is pleasant to read,
appears between them. It is said too that no
breath of scandal touched Ptolemy Euergetes’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
name, which is indeed an unique record in his
family. Like many other princes, and others of
a later day, Euergetes may have been sent abroad
to complete his education and see some thing of
the world. If these travels led him to Cyrene, as
appears likely, since he was proclaimed Lord of
the same on the death of Magas, he may have
become familiar with the lady of his choice and
seen or heard tales of her prowess. A brave
and valiant figure, this same Berenike II, warm-hearted,
affectionate and courageous to a degree.
Stories are told of her valor in rescuing her
father, when in the midst of enemies, by riding in
among and putting them to flight. Like the late
Empress of Austria she was a splendid horsewoman,
was accustomed to break horses for the
Olympian games and performed other equestrian
feats.</p>

<p>An individual figure was she, like her predecessor
on the throne of Egypt, Arsinoe II, but a
very different one, save in the fact that the husband
of both seemed devoted to them. With
these experiences behind her Berenike could not
have been very young when she became queen of
Egypt. Such as she was, doubtless handsome,
intrepid and fascinating, she won the heart of a
prince to whom she seems to have given her own
unreservedly; even so the course of true love did
not run quite smooth. Her mother, Berenike,
also opposed the match, for reasons not given,
but did not succeed in breaking it off. One line
by a poet of the time gives an attractive touch
to the picture of the new queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>“He who seated facing thee sees and hears thy
laughter sweet.”</p>

<p>Of her, too, we have portraits on the coins,
beautiful, regular-featured and conventional.
These were gold octadrams and others. In some
she appears with the king, in some alone, with
diadem, veil and necklace. Others are remarkable
for the absence of the veil, there is a cornucopia
and it is accompanied by a single star.
Berenike II was the first Egyptian queen who
bore her title on the coins.</p>

<p>Shortly before the accession of Ptolemy III
and his marriage, which occurred 247 B. C., had
come the tragic news of the murder of his sister
Berenike, the young queen of Syria, of which it is
uncertain whether his father was aware. Euergetes,
apparently the most personally valiant and
warlike of the three first Ptolemies, set out to
avenge her death.</p>

<p>Queen Berenike II implored the gods to restore
her beloved husband, and vowed to Venus
the tresses of her hair, bright, beautiful and
abundant, in case of his safe return. Fragments
of papyri, found by Professor Petrie, confirm the
fact that the king was successful in his war, and
came again in triumph. With what rejoicing
he was received by his wife we can well imagine,
who faithfully carried out her vow and this
“woman’s crown” was placed in the sanctuary.
The king, while highly appreciating this token of
affection, must have felt some regret at the sacrifice.
It recalls a story of later date where the
Duchess of Marlborough, of the time of William
III, cut off her beautiful hair, not to dedicate it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
to the gods, but to throw it indignantly at her
husband’s feet, as revenge for some act of his
of which she did not approve. She had not even
the satisfaction of rousing him, for he took no
notice, but after his death she found locked up in
a drawer her heavy curls, which he had always
admired.</p>

<p>Berenike’s hair, however, was stolen from the
temple, to the grief and indignation of the king.
To account for it courtiers and poets devised legends
and the mathematician Conon said it had
been raised to the heavens to become a constellation,
the “Coma Berenice,” a small group of stars
still to be seen. Of this miracle Catullus wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Behold we stream along the liquid air,</div>
<div class="verse">A radiant lock of Berenice’s hair,</div>
<div class="verse">Which the fond queen with hands uplifted vow’d</div>
<div class="verse">A welcome offering to each favoring god.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And speaking of the king it continues:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Speed his return, with triumph crown his stay,</div>
<div class="verse">And subject Asian realms to Egypt’s sway;</div>
<div class="verse">This once attained, among the gods I shine,</div>
<div class="verse">Absolving all thy oaths a new made sign.”</div>
<div class="verse">“That the yellow tresses of my fair</div>
<div class="verse">Sacred to love might gild the illumed air.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the hair, impersonated by the poet, laments
its separation from its mistress’s head. These
flights of fancy were no doubt very pleasing to
the king.</p>

<p>Like her mother-in-law, if to a less degree,
Berenike II seems to have taken an active interest
in the affairs of the kingdom. At Canopus,
an old trading post, a temple was erected to the
king and queen, who were there deified as “Benefactor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
Gods,” referring probably to the active
measures which they took to avert a threatened
famine. From the Canopus decree which bears
some resemblance to the celebrated Rosetta stone,
and from a gold plaque found in the ruins of
tombs we obtain this information. In the sanctuary
at Philae is still a pedestal placed here by
Euergetes and his wife, on which stood the sacred
boat with the image of Isis, and on a wall in the
same temple is his father Ptolemy Philadelphus
offering incense and pouring water on the altar.</p>

<p>To the Princess Berenike, probably the first
child of this marriage, who had died, a statue was
set up, beside the gods. The head-dress of young
Berenike differs in that it has two ears of corn,
in the midst of which is the asp-shaped diadem,
behind is a papyrus-shaped sceptre, about which
the tail of the diadem’s serpent is wound.</p>

<p>The year after the Canopus decree, the tenth
of his reign, Ptolemy Euergetes went with great
pomp to the refounding of the temple of Edfu, in
Upper Egypt, one of the most splendid with
which the Ptolemy name is connected, and where
a great feast was held for six days.</p>

<p>We know but little definitely about the private
life of the king and queen, but one or two incidents
connected with her are preserved. Other
wives or mistresses, claimants on her husband’s
affection, made no figure, if they existed, so we
may believe Berenike’s marriage relations to have
been more than usually peaceful and happy.
One pleasant anecdote is told of her which Mahaffy
gives in a footnote. While the king was
one day playing at dice, an officer came to him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
read out a list of criminals to be condemned, but
the queen gently took it away and would not
allow him to decide so important a matter so
hastily, and at such a time, and it further states
that the king yielded to her wishes. That the
queen thus dared to interfere and the king so
readily accepted her action seems to give proof
of the peculiarly amiable relations existing between
them.</p>

<p>The queen is also spoken of as a patroness of
various aromatic oils, toilette articles, etc., which
leads us to suppose she was particular about and
careful of her personal appearance. Ptolemy
Euergetes was, like his predecessor, fat and handsome,
with a full, voluptuous face. The early
Ptolemies all had full, voluptuous faces, but
handsome, while in the cases of their successors
the features were less regular, the nose sharper,
and the chin more prominent.</p>

<p>The royal pair had several children, of whom
the oldest succeeded his father, the king dying
in the twenty-fifth year of his reign. The three
first Ptolemies were men of mark, their descendants
were decadents, profligate, perfidious and
cruel, unfaithful in every way to moral obligations
and their task of governing.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Philopator was a young man when he
ascended the throne, 222 B. C., his name is said
to signify “the son designated for the throne by
his father,” with whom, as was so frequently the
case, he had probably already been associated in
the government. Some authors even suggest
that he was not even innocent of the death of
this parent, as that of the other was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
laid at his door, and that he selected the name
Philopater to disarm suspicion. But possibly,
like Cambyses, as he proved himself a man of evil,
nothing was too bad to believe of him. Immediately
on his accession he murdered his younger
brother Magas, of this there seems no doubt.
Berenike II was much attached to this younger
son and perhaps wished him to succeed his father,
as Philadelphus had done, in preference to Keraunos,
which may have been the cause of the
new king’s unnatural hatred against her, she was
given in charge of Sosibios, an official and favorite
of the king’s, and is said either to have been
murdered or committed suicide by poison, so unendurable
to the high-spirited princess was her
imprisonment. She who had been reigning
queen and so beloved. It was a melancholy close
to her life’s story.</p>

<p>A number of other murders are laid to the
king’s charge, through the influence of the same
Sosibios. Polybius, who is deemed a reliable
authority on this period, says the king “would
attend to no business and would hardly grant an
interview to the officials about the court,” but
was “absorbed in unworthy intrigues and senseless
and continual drunkenness,” and “treated the
several branches of the government with equal
indifference;” all was managed by the officials, or
any who might seize the power. His generals
fought his battles and gained his victories, with
little thanks due to the wisdom or judgment of
the king. Agathocles and Sosibios were his
leading ministers. But occasionally, at least, he
seems to have roused himself and appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
person on the field, as we read of his setting
out from Alexandria with 70,000 infantry, 5,000
cavalry and 73 elephants. At Raphia was fought
a great battle, between Antiochus of Syria and
Ptolemy, which was opened by a charge of elephants
in which the Egyptians came off victorious.</p>

<p>And here we catch a glimpse of the next queen
of Egypt (subsequently deified with her husband
as gods Philapatores) Arsinoe III, daughter of
Euergetes I and Berenike II. She accompanied
her brother and rode with him, a fearless horsewoman,
like her mother, perhaps, in front of the
troops, before the battle, exhorting the soldiers
to courage and conquest. Like her mother also
she is said to have dedicated a lock of her hair
in the temple, but the story is not so well authenticated.
Besides this little glimpse of her personality
at the battle, which shows vigor and bravery,
we learn little of her, probably she was
fair, perhaps virtuous. She was a late child of
her parents’ marriage, it may be the youngest,
and it seems to be implied that she was early left
an orphan and had a sad youth. It was some
years after this battle about 213 B. C. that she
was married to Ptolemy Philopator, and became
Arsinoe III of Egypt. Her husband, given to
debauchery, amusing himself with literary work,
a taste he shared with the earlier Ptolemies, and
not, we may imagine, of a very high character,
and under the influence of his minister, Sosibios,
as well as Agathocles and Agathoclea, sister of
the latter, could not have been a very love inspiring
companion. The queen bore a son in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
210 or 209 B. C., who succeeded his father at
five years of age, under the title of Ptolemy V,
Epiphanes.</p>

<p>The cruelties to the Jews practiced or allowed
by Ptolemy IV were in contrast to the policy of
his predecessors, and though some inscriptions remain
(the temple of Edfu has mention of this)
which do him honor, the weight of testimony
seems to be that he was an oppressive and cruel
king and hated by his subjects. Yet these few
inscriptions, as is frequently the case, for in any
important matter the testimony is often conflicting,
give a different and better view of his
character. The chief cause of, or accessory to
many murders he undoubtedly was.</p>

<p>A temple in Nubia gives pictures of Ptolemy
Philopater and his wife, Arsinoe III, receiving
offerings, as well as those of his father and
mother, grandfather and grandmother. It is
thought that the Prince of Nubia may have assisted
in putting down a revolt of his subjects.</p>

<p>The murder of Arsinoe III was due to the influence
of the king’s shameless mistress, Agathoclea
and her brother Agathocles, but what had
made the unfortunate queen especially obnoxious
to them we do not know. Perhaps she was
merely an obstacle in the path of their ambition,
and they thought that if they could get the child
absolutely in their power they could regulate
things better to their own liking; perhaps some
stories, true or false, were raised against the
queen to justify their proceedings. She seems
to have had a sad life and to have been friendless
in the midst of enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>There is something very pathetic in the story
of the early life of Ptolemy V., Epiphanes, who
became king, at five years of age, his father dead,
his mother murdered, so soon that he could
scarcely have remembered her, and he left in the
hands of her murderers. Polybius gives a picture
of these events in the following words: “The
next step of Agathocles was to summon a meeting
of the Macedonian guards. He entered the
assembly accompanied by the young king and his
own sister, Agathoclea. At first he feigned not
to be able to say what he wished for tears, but
after again and again wiping his eyes with his
chlamys, he at length mastered his emotion, and,
taking the young king in his arms, he spoke as
follows: Take this boy, whom his father on his
death bed placed in this lady’s care (pointing to
his sister) and confided to your loyalty, men of
Macedonia. Her affection has but little influence
in securing the child’s safety; it is on you
that safety now depends, ‘his fortunes are in your
hands.’” He then proceeded to inveigh against
Tlepolemus, governor of Pelusium, and a general
in the army, who was evidently popular with the
soldiers and in so doing overshot his mark.</p>

<p>The murder of the queen, and even of the
man into whose hands the letter ordering the
same had fallen, seems gradually to have been
traced (though at first kept secret) to its true
authors, and this added to other acts of cruelty
and unlawful seizure of power, raised a storm
of feeling among the soldiers and the populace
generally, against Agathocles and his associates,
and his words were received with “hootings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
loud murmurs,” so that he began to fear the
worst for himself and made haste to escape. The
fury of a mob, of any nationality and at any
period of the world’s history, once raised, is not
easy to allay, and seldom have such uprisings
been known, unattended by bloodshed. In this,
as in other cases, there were some leaders ready
to fan rather than to extinguish the flame of
popular wrath, and they determined to overthrow
the obnoxious ministers.</p>

<p>The whole city was in a ferment and the next
morning the Macedonian guard broke open the
palace, seized the person of the little king, placed
him on horseback and led him among the people,
who shouted and clapped their hands. They
then put him on the royal seat and extracted from
the, doubtless frightened, child permission to surrender
to the populace “those who had injured
him or his mother.” Pitiful it must have been to
see a mere baby placed in such circumstances.
Whether he really understood anything of what
was going on, or had any affection for those in
question we cannot tell. It of course resulted in
the murder of Agathocles and all his kinsfolk.
A fate well deserved perhaps by most of them, but
horrible to contemplate. But the dreadful thirst
for blood was awakened in the angry crowd, and
there were bound to be victims, more or less
numerous.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_26">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIXTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">PTOLEMY QUEENS (CONTINUED).</span></h2>

<p>Thus tragically was ushered in the reign of
the boy-king, Ptolemy V, Epiphanes, the Illustrious,
whose dates are 205-182 B. C., and whose
pre-nomen or throne name, found on his cartouch,
means “heir of the (two) father loving
gods, chosen of Ptah, strength of the Ka of Ra,
living image of Amen.” Too young to take
matters into his own hands, the power seems to
have been divided between Tlepolemus as military,
and Aristomenes, called the king’s tutor, as
civil administrator of affairs. The reign of a
minor is apt to be distracted by conflicts of one
sort and another, and this proved no exception.</p>

<p>In the case of the youthful son of Alexander
the Great it was the generals of his father’s army
who wrested from him his inheritance; in that
of the young Ptolemy it was the foreign powers,
the kings of Macedonia and Syria, who sought
to do so. But the Romans proved the instruments
of the boy’s salvation, though not for his
sake, and conquered in battle and made tributary
the men who were his enemies, while the two
ministers who had taken his affairs in charge
guarded him well at home.</p>

<p>There are also some who maintain that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
guardianship of the boy’s rights was offered to
the Romans, though the weight of evidence seems
against this idea. Certain it is, however, that
Ptolemy Epiphanes, or those who acted for him,
sent very submissive embassies to this great and
growing power, destined eventually to swallow
up his country, or rather to become possessed of
its sovereignty.</p>

<p>We cannot trace the course of foreign wars or
native rebellions, but must return to the more
domestic aspect of the history. The little king
lived in Alexandria and very early in his life
there seems to have been some suggestion of his
marriage with the daughter of the king of Syria,
and in the seventh year of his reign, when he
must have been about twelve, it is said that the
betrothal took place. It was of course a political
alliance, to cement a good understanding between
the two nations. How much greater the privileges
and the independence, at least on the question
of marriage, of the private individual over
the sometimes envied king or queen.</p>

<p>At thirteen or fourteen years of age Ptolemy
V was crowned at Memphis and the decree of
the Rosetta Stone was issued. It begins “In the
reign of the young,” and then goes on to enumerate
the king’s ancestors, to name priests and
priestesses, and to give a detailed list of the benefits
his Majesty had bestowed upon the kingdom,
“in requittal of which the gods have given him
health, victory, power and all other good things,
his sovereignty remaining to him and his children
for all time. With propitious fortune. It
seemed good to the priests of all the temples in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
the land to increase greatly the existing honors
of the king, Ptolemy, his parents, grand-parents,
etc.” As Ptolemy was but in early childhood
when he is said to have bestowed so many benefits
upon the kingdom it was to his ministers
rather than to himself that any such praise was
due. Possibly it was a mutual agreement between
them and the priests to strengthen his
power, since there seemed more chance of dispute
in the case of a child than when a full-grown
man had ascended the throne.</p>

<p>The Rosetta Stone has been virtually the key
which has, in part at least, revealed the mysteries
of the Hieroglyphics to Europeans. The inscription
was written in Hieroglyphic, the original
form of Egyptian writing, in the Demotic, the
subsequent and common language of later dynasties,
and in Greek, which was of course largely
introduced by the Ptolemies. And as the three
inscriptions are approximately alike, Greek scholars
were able to interpret the two former by the
last. The original Rosetta Stone is in the British
Museum, but copies of it may be seen in many of
the collections abroad, and in the United States,
such as the University of Pennsylvania, etc.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the boy-king was growing to manhood
and there is record of his being trained to
equestrianism and athletic sports. At a certain
banquet an ambassador, in speaking of the king,
“said a great deal in his praise, quoting anecdotes
of his skill and boldness in hunting, as well
as his excellence in riding and the use of arms;”
and ended by averring in proof of this that “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
king on horseback once transfixed a bull with a
javelin.”</p>

<p>When Ptolemy Epiphanes was but sixteen or
seventeen his marriage took place, the new queen
being presumably near his age. With her we
enter on the puzzling list of Cleopatras, and she
seems to have been a woman of character and
ability, and worthy of respect. Her father, Antiochus
of Syria, a country with which the inter-marriages
of the kings of this dynasty were
very frequent, brought her to the bridegroom,
with a splendid retinue, and the nuptials were
handsomely celebrated at the border town of
Raphia. It was here that the mother of the king
had ridden before the troops many years previously
to encourage them on the eve of the battle
between Ptolemy IV. and Antiochus. The
dowry of the bride was the taxes of Coele, Syria
and Palestine, but not, it is said, the possession
of the land.</p>

<p>The young queen loyally accepted the duties
and obligations attaching to her new position;
“Thy people shall be my people” was the spirit
that distinguished her actions, and she stood to
this even when her husband’s interests were opposed
to those of her native country. It is said
of her that she was a “vigorous and prudent
woman, and she certainly introduced new blood
into a stock likely to degenerate from the constant
unions of close blood relations.” Nor do
there seem to be any special stories recorded of
cruelty on her part, such as we have in other
instances of Ptolemy queens. We may presume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
also that she had more or less claim to beauty
and had attractions both of person and mind.</p>

<p>Like his predecessors, Ptolemy V. worked upon
the temples, notably that of Philæ. The temple
of Asklepias was especially credited to this king,
and we cannot but suppose that the queen, too,
had a great interest. An inscription, the duplicate
of the Rosetta Stone, was placed on one of
the walls at Philæ by Epiphanes, but afterwards
carved out by another ruler.</p>

<p>Cleopatra I, like some others of the Ptolemy
women, was the superior of the man to whom
she was united, yet, as far as we can judge at
this distance of time, the marriage was on the
whole a harmonious and satisfactory one. At
least no special quarrels are recorded and the
husband did not make way with his wife in the
all too common fashion. She seems to have been
joined with her husband in public acts, as were
Ptolemy Philadelphus and Arsinoe II, even when
these were directed against her father and her
native land. Mahaffy says that it is noteworthy
that Livy speaks of the king and queen as of
equal importance, but perhaps this may have referred
to Cleopatra I. and her son when she was
regent, rather than to her husband. Livy says
“Ambassadors were sent from Ptolemy and Cleopatra,
sovereigns of Egypt, with congratulations
that Manius Acilius, the consul, had driven King
Antiochus from Greece, and advising the Romans
to send their army over to Asia, that all Syria
as well as Asia was in a panic, that the sovereigns
of Egypt were prepared to do whatever the senate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
desired.” A proof that Egypt was now continually
bending before the power of Rome.</p>

<p>Ptolemy wished to secure some of the Syrian
provinces and of the queen it is said “she was
always striving to spread her influence towards
the North.”</p>

<p>Disputes had arisen between the priests and the
crown as to the dowries of the late deified
queens, which had become part of the temple
revenues, and were again absorbed by the throne.
This with other causes resulted in a revolution
led by the last native prince whose claim preceded
that of the Ptolemies, which was put down
with much cruelty and broken faith by the king.
It is these insurrections, occurring frequently in
the reigns of the later Ptolemies, that are believed
to be one cause of Egypt’s submissive
attitude towards Rome.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Epiphanes seems less odious than his
predecessor, but as he grew to manhood, he, too,
was accused of cruel murders, among them that
of his tutor Aristomenes, to whose care it seems
as if he must have owed much. The cartouch of
Ptolemy V. is said to be the most rarely found
on Ptolemic buildings. He also worked at Edfu
and Philæ, the “so-called chapel of Aesculapius,”
at the latter place having an inscription declaring
it to be founded by “Ptolemy Epiphanes and
Cleopatra and their son, to Imhotep, the son of
Ptah.” In modern times a temple said to be
built by them, at Antæpolis, was undermined and
destroyed by the Nile.</p>

<p>The king died, murdered by poison by some
of his courtiers, while still a young man, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
twenty-ninth year and twenty-fifth of his reign,
and was succeeded by his son under the guardianship
of his mother. Whether the queen
deeply mourned her husband or whether his increasing
vices had alienated her from him we
cannot say. She was doubtless an ambitious
woman and not averse to holding the reins of
power. There are coins of hers issued during
her regency. She is there called queen, which
is not the case with all the wives of the different
kings, and appears as Isis (though with a less
conventional face than some), wearing a corn
wreath, above which are a globe and horns. A
copper coin gives her as Isis with long curls and
a band with corn. She seems to have been an
able ruler and survived her husband some eight
years, dying in 174 B. C. before she had fairly
entered on middle life. There were several children
of this marriage, and, as if for the bewilderment
of students, the sons are called Ptolemy and
the daughter Cleopatra. During the queen’s regency
Egypt seems to have remained peaceful
and we have no revolting tales of murder or
general bloodshed.</p>

<p>The matter of succession now became somewhat
involved, so often was it disputed and so
frequently divided between rival claimants. Mahaffy
says, “From henceforth we have almost
constantly rival brothers asserting themselves in
turn, queen mothers controlling their king sons—intestine
feuds and bloodshed in the royal
house, till the stormy end of the dynasty with
the daring Cleopatra VI.”</p>

<p>Some call Philometer the VI and some the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
VII. If the latter there was probably an elder
brother, Ptolemy Eupator, thus called the VI,
who survived his father but for a brief period,
being nominally king, and then died. Certain
it is that the Syrian Cleopatra I was regent and
that one of her sons, Philometor, succeeded to
the actual power, 173 B. C. He reverted to the
earlier customs and married his sister Cleopatra,
who then became the second queen of the name.
This union is believed to have taken place a year
after the death of his mother in 173 B. C. Perhaps
had she lived she might have arranged for a
different connection.</p>

<p>The peaceful period of the regency of Cleopatra
I. now came to an end and Egypt prepared
to seize the lands which had furnished the
dowry of the late queen, the three powers,
Egypt, Syria and Rome being involved, the two
first in active warfare. This resulted in the capture
and imprisonment of the Egyptian king by
the Syrian monarch, Antiochus IV at a battle
which occurred on the borders of Egypt. The
people of Alexandria, who it is said spoke more
completely the voice of Egypt than Paris does
of France, made a counter move by raising to the
throne the younger brother, a lad of fifteen or
sixteen, who took the name of Euergetes II,
later called Physcon, the “pot bellied” or “the
fat,” Ptolemy VI, and who in his proportions
accentuated the usual liberal outline of the
Ptolemy race. The youth proved strong and ambitious
enough to hold on to the power thus
secured and never willingly relaxed his grasp.</p>

<p>Antiochus then attacked Alexandria with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
nominal purpose of restoring Philometer.
Through their mother the young kings were of
course related to the invader, but the relationship
seems to have had little effect in preventing a contest.
Different authorities give different names
and numbers to the various Ptolemy kings and
we have taken Mahaffy, who has devoted much
time to the study of this period, as our special
guide.</p>

<p>Antiochus IV finally left Philometer at Memphis
and returned home. The latter, apparently
seeing the folly of a divided sovereignty and
realizing that he would no longer be recognized
as sole king, made overtures to his brother and,
owing, it is said, to the mediation of their sister
Cleopatra, they came to terms in 170 B. C. This
compact roused Antiochus IV. to a renewed attack.
The beseeching embassies of the Ptolemies
to Rome, however, finally produced an effect and
Antiochus was ordered to withdraw and the
powerful Romans virtually held a sort of protectorate
over Egypt till they finally and absolutely
absorbed it. The embassies of Philometer
and Cleopatra II professed that they were more
indebted to the Senate and people of Rome, than
to their own parents, more than to the immortal
gods since by their help they had been relieved
from Antiochus, and Rome seemed disposed to
keep up the agreeable sentiment, as their embassy
is recorded as having brought a purple gown and
vest and an ivory chair to King Philometer, and
an embroidered gown and a purple robe for
Queen Cleopatra II.</p>

<p>The king and queen are spoken of in all solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
datings as “gods Philopatores.” On the walls of
the temple at Der el Medineh there are pictures
of Ptolemy VII and IX and Cleopatra II, and
a Syrian coin of Philometer gives a strong head
and face. There are inscriptions relating to
Ptolemy Philometer, wife and children, in Nubia.
It was after the Romans restored Philometer to
Egypt that he and his queen made their solemn
progress to Memphis.</p>

<p>Some of the so-called “friends of the king”
tried to make trouble between the brothers and
to induce the younger to slay the elder, implying
that Philometer had designs upon him. But in
this instance Euergetes, usually regarded with
abhorrence, showed himself at his best and dismissed
suspicions and to prove their harmony
went with his brother in royal apparel to show
themselves to the people. A quarrel, however,
eventually broke out between them, Philometer
was expelled and threw himself on the protection
of the Romans, who were thus continually able
to interfere in the affairs of Egypt. The Romans
decreed that the kingdom should be divided between
the two, which of course gave satisfaction
to neither, and Euergetes II went to Rome
to protest against the division. An interesting
and almost an amusing episode is connected with
this visit when, it is said, Euergetes asked Cornelia,
the mother of the Gracci, to marry him.
The lady, however, declined, “probably,” says one
writer, “she held him in such esteem as an English
noblewoman now would hold an Indian Rajah
proposing marriage.”</p>

<p>The quarrels and fighting between the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
brothers continued, but finally Euergetes attacked
Cyprus which had been adjudged by the Romans
to Philometer, and was forced to surrender.
Philometer now showed himself the generous one,
for he forgave Euergetes, restored him to Cyrene
and for the last eight or nine years of his reign
remained at peace with him.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_27">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">PTOLEMY QUEENS (CONTINUED).</span></h2>

<p>Cleopatra II appears with her husband Philometor,
Ptolemy VII, in statutes excavated at
Cyprus, which were set up “at a temple to the
Paphian Aphrodite,” yet we know little of her.
There is also an appeal spoken of by Josephus in
which a certain Jew begs the king and queen’s
permission to build a temple to the God of Israel
and reports their majesties’ favorable reply, but
the story is not altogether credited. We hear
also of the king and queen receiving other petitions,
usually a popular action. Polybius, whose
testimony seems so generally full and reliable was
in Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy Philometer.</p>

<p>Of course there was a daughter of Philometor
and Cleopatra II, also called Cleopatra, whom
Philometor gave in marriage to an aspirant to the
throne of Syria (though apparently not the rightful
heir) called Alexander Bala, and accompanied
the princess to Ptolemais in Palestine, where the
ceremony took place, probably about 150 B. C.
After this Ptolemy VII discovered a real or pretended
conspiracy against his life, in which his
new son-in-law was implicated. He then went
over to the side of the other claimant to the
Syrian throne, Demetrius Nicator, and regardless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
of the marriage contract previously concluded,
transferred his daughter to him. She
seems to have been still in the power of her
father, rather than that of her husband, and
neither she nor her mother appear to have had
any voice in the matter. It is possible she may
not have really lived with Bala at all.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Philometor himself was crowned king
at Antioch, and it is on this account, probably, we
have the Syrian coin with his head, but he evidently
did not care to retain the position, for he
finally persuaded the people to accept Demetrius
in his stead.</p>

<p>Philometor, Ptolemy VII., died, as had few of
his race, in, or rather as the result of, a battle, he
was thrown from an elephant, or some say a
horse, like Keraunos, and wounded by his enemies
with fatal results following, first having learned
of the death of Bala, with whom he had been
fighting. In contrast with his brother Euergetes
II. he is spoken well of by many writers, and his
gentleness and humanity are dwelt upon, which
recalls the familiar axiom that “all things go by
comparison.” So some speak highly of and some
judge him harshly. In youth he is said to have
been handsome, with a countenance full of sweet
expression. His death occurred 146 B. C.</p>

<p>There were now again rival claimants for the
throne, Euergetes II, Physcon, the brother of the
late king, with whom the kingdom had been
divided, and Ptolemy Philometor’s son, Ptolemy
Neos, Philopator II, Ptolemy VIII, whose cause
his mother Cleopatra II. espoused. But Physcon
proved to be the more powerful and either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
directly or indirectly murdered his young nephew,
feeling that while the boy lived his own claim to
the throne would not be secure. It is said the
unfortunate heir had been recognized as the
crown prince over the whole empire, not only at
Cyprus, but at Philæ, for Professor Cayce found
on the island of Huseh a granite slab, which had
supported figures of the king and queen with
this youth standing between them.</p>

<p>The list of queens, a puzzling one, as all must
admit, is as follows: Ptolemy I, Sotor, married
Eurydike, and Berenike I, Ptolemy II, Philadelphus,
married Arsinoe I and Arsinoe II; Ptolemy
III, Euergetes I, married Berenike II;
Ptolemy IV, Philopator, married Arsinoe III;
Ptolemy V, Epiphanes, married Cleopatra I;
Ptolemy VI, Eupator, died in childhood. Ptolemy
VII, Philometor, married Cleopatra II;
Ptolemy VIII, Philopator II, Neos, was murdered
in youth. Ptolemy IX, Euergetes II,
Physcon, married Cleopatra I, widow of his
brother, and Cleopatra III, his niece. Ptolemy
X, Lathyrus, married Cleopatra IV, and subsequently
Selene, his sisters. Ptolemy XI, Alexander,
married Berenike III, whose parentage
seems in doubt. Ptolemy XII, Alexander II,
married this same Berenike, his stepmother.
Ptolemy XIII, Auletes married Cleopatra V,
surnamed Tryphæna. Ptolemy XIV and Ptolemy
XV reigned in conjunction with their sister,
Cleopatra VI, to whom they were successively
married, and died young, as did Ptolemy
XVI, her son Cæsarion, who died unmarried.</p>

<p>Within the year (and some say the murder of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
her son occurred during the nuptial ceremonial)
Physcon married the widow of his brother, Cleopatra
II. Evidently no love was lost between
them; how could it be under the circumstances?
If this marriage, perhaps, insisted on by the
Alexandrian party of Cleopatra II, she having a
claim to the crown, jointly with her brothers,
there seems to have been one son, Memphites,
who soon died, or was murdered, it is even reported,
by his own unnatural father, who feared
a rival.</p>

<p>Cleopatra II. had two daughters of the same
name. The elder was married first to Alexander
Bala and then to Demetrius Nicator of Syria.
She seems to have been an embodiment of Ptolemaic
cruelty and vice. When her second husband
was taken prisoner, she accepted his brother,
Antiochus Sidetes, in his stead, and placed him
upon the throne. But nine years afterwards, on
the return of Demetrius, murdered Sidetes and
her son Seleukos, who had attempted to assume
the crown. She had also, it is said, prepared
poison for her second son, Antiochus Grippus, but
he discovered her intent and forced her to swallow
the fatal draught herself. Her younger sister
Cleopatra, only a year or two after Physcon’s
marriage with her mother Cleopatra II, he also
took to wife, thus establishing one of the most
revolting connections entered into by any member
of this atrocious family, yet, strange to say,
both were recognized in public acts as queens of
Egypt, the younger bearing the title of Cleopatra
III. Incomprehensible and repellant as this
seems, it appears well authenticated. There is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
relief of Philometer, clad in a white mantle, and
accompanied by one of the Cleopatras. At Kom
Ombos there is on the wall of the temple a picture
of Ptolemy VII, and also of Ptolemy IX,
between the goddesses and again of Horus bestowing
gifts on Ptolemy IX. and the two Cleopatras.
We read of an inscription from Kos, too,
where the children of both were perhaps educated,
in which “the king and his two queens
honor with a golden crown and gilded image the
tutor of their children.”</p>

<p>In 146 B. C. Physcon apparently married Cleopatra II.
and two or three years later her daughter.
In 130 or 129 B. C. he was exiled and
obliged to flee the country, Cleopatra II reigning
alone for about two years, at the expiration
of which time the absent king returned and again
took the power into his own hands. In his private
life Ptolemy Physcon appears as a monster,
in his public career he has been esteemed by some
writers as a good, or at least a great king. That
is, his sway was widely extended, and he built
or added to innumerable temples to the gods. At
Edfu, begun by Ptolemy III, Euergetes, in 237
B. C., he completed the great hypostile hall, in
122 B. C. At Der-el-Medineh he finished the
graceful temple begun by Ptolemy IV. and dedicated
to Hathor. At El Kab he built a rock
temple, while at Karnak and many other places
he added his portion to the great whole. “At
Thebes we find no reign so marked.” He seems
to have showed special favor to the native Egyptian
population, but is credited with many cruelties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
to others. With Rome he kept up friendly,
if subservient, relations.</p>

<p>At what precise time the elder Cleopatra
passed away from the scene we do not know, but
she died before Physcon, leaving her successor to
a certain extent to re-enact her story. Physcon
gave his daughter Tryphena to Grippus, the
Syrian prince who had poisoned his mother, and
her aunt, Cleopatra. Ptolemy IX, Physcon, died
in 117 B. C., having reigned twenty-nine years
since the death of his brother, Philometor. His
widow, Cleopatra III, Cocce, succeeded to the
power and is sometimes called queen, sometimes
regent. She appears to have held the position for
a while alone, and then her son, Ptolemy X,
Philometor, or Sotor II (Lathyrus), was associated
with her. She was, it is said, a “strong
and remarkable woman,” considerably younger
than her husband and having great influence with
him. She succeeded in having the elder son,
and natural successor, sent away, as governor to
Cyprus, and thus deprived him of the power of
claiming his inheritance. She preferred her
younger son Alexander, whom she had made independent
king of Cyprus, but the people would
not accept him, and Ptolemy X (Lathyrus), as
has been said, succeeded. He apparently was
already married to his sister, another Cleopatra,
called the IV, but his mother obliged him, from
motives not clear to us, though it has been suggested
that it was because only such children as
were born to the purple, could reign; to put her
away and marry a younger sister Selene. This
queen’s name does not appear in some of the inscriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
which read “in the name of Queen
Cleopatra and King Ptolemy, gods Philometores,
Sotores and his children.”</p>

<p>This Cleopatra IV was, no more than the
rest of the Ptolemy women, meek or submissive.
She naturally resented the treatment she had received
and offered herself and the riches of which
she seemed possessed to one of the claimants of
the Syrian throne, but only to meet the too common
fate, for the wife of the said Antiochus
Grippus, her own sister Tryphæna, caused her
to be murdered. Some of the Egyptian princesses,
as has been narrated, went to Syria, and
of them it is said that “they show the usual features
ascribed to Ptolemaic princesses—great
power and wealth which makes an alliance with
them imply the command of large resources in
men and money; mutual hatred, disregard of all
ties of family and affection; the dearest object
fratricide—such pictures of depravity as make
any reasonable man pause and ask whether human
nature had deserted these women and the
Hyrcanian tiger of the past taken its place.”</p>

<p>The history of the Jews is largely involved with
that of Egypt during many of the Ptolemy reigns,
but it is not within the scope of this small monograph
to include these relationships in the more
purely personal story. The new king, to a
greater or less extent, now held the power, as
testified to by the coinage bearing simply “the
year of Lathyrus” instead of his mother Cleopatra
III. He appears in a copper coin clad in
an elephant skin, and there are also joint coins
of Cleopatra III and Alexander. The queen, indisposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
to yield her authority, succeeded in raising
the populace against Lathyrus, so that he
fled to Cyprus, his brother Alexander returning
from there and sharing the throne with his
mother. Lathyrus meanwhile was attempting to
set up a kingdom in Palestine, but the powerful
queen wrested it from him and added it to her
own dominions. Ptolemy Apion, an illegitimate
son of Ptolemy Physcon, had been ruling in
Cyrene the home and possession of the former
queen, Berenike II, which he left on his death
to the Roman people, who thus, whenever their
other warlike entanglements permitted, tightened
their grasp on everything Egyptian, but the
Egyptian monarchs, busy with more personal
and family difficulties, did not interfere.</p>

<p>Ptolemy X, Alexander I, reigned with his
mother till 101 B. C. when, weary perhaps of her
powerful hand, which kept him from full possession
of the throne, he murdered her. Possibly
she would have done the like to him, but
it seems a shocking and ungrateful return for
the preference for him which she at first so
evidently showed. Other authorities throw some
doubt on this matricide, but the weight of opinion
seems to certify to it.</p>

<p>The next queen is spoken of as Cleopatra,
Berenike IV, or Berenike III, and her name
is sometimes associated both with Alexander,
whom she married, and the queen mother. She
is believed to have been a daughter of Sotor II
(Lathyrus), and hence Alexander’s niece. This
marriage may not have been agreeable to the
elder queen, who so evidently hated her elder son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
the father of the bride. This king is sometimes
spoken of as “Ptolemy, also called Alexander,
the god Philometor.” In the midst of these domestic
quarrels and public difficulties, the king
yet kept up the usual habit of temple building
and his name appears in connection with several,
especially Denderah. Says Mahaffy: “It is difficult
not to suspect in the continued building of
the same temples by Philometor and Euergetes
II, of Sotor II, and of Alexander, the influence
of the great ladies who lived through the change
of kings without stay or intermittence of their
royalty,” though, strange to say, the priests of
Edfu do not speak of them. Alexander appears
in communion with the gods and, triumphing
over his enemies. “It is also certain that the
crypts of the temple of Denderah, finished by
Cleopatra VI, were commenced according to an
ancient plan by the X and XI Ptolemies.”</p>

<p>After the murder of Cleopatra III the people
rose against Alexander and recalled Lathyrus,
who, upon regaining the crown, pursued his
brother, who was slain in a naval battle, thus
leaving his widow Berenike III to share with
her father the Egyptian throne. She seems to
have lived at peace with him after his return
and is regarded by some as co-regent or ruler,
by others as not assuming power till after his
death.</p>

<p>Lathyrus is considered as among the gentler
and better members of the Ptolemy family. Even
so he put down a rebellion of the native population
with great severity and razed Thebes to the
ground. Dying, at about the age of sixty, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
left the kingdom in the hands of his daughter,
Cleopatra IV, Berenike III, who reigned for
some six months, when Alexander, son of Alexander
I, by another marriage, returned from
Rome and was accepted as king, under the title
of Alexander II, Ptolemy XII, sharing the
throne with Berenike, the queen. Though his
stepmother, there was probably no great disparity
in their years, and it was by the suggestion
of the Roman dictator, Sylla, that he contracted
this strange alliance. But the abhorrent
connection was of brief duration, for Alexander
II murdered his wife and was himself murdered
in turn by her household troops, within a month.
As queen or regent she had been associated with
the royal power for a number of years, and this
prompt avengement of her death seems to prove
that she had her share of popularity.</p>

<p>At this period, and indeed for a long time,
what the Alexandrians willed seems to have been
law to the whole country.</p>

<p>The Ptolemy queens were women, as a rule, presumably
handsome, certainly able and sagacious,
ambitious and brave, daring and cruel. To differentiate
them accurately, particularly the latter
members of the family, who were on the throne
briefly, and in quick succession, requires a more
extended knowledge of the subject than has
yet been secured, either by the researches of students
or the “finds” of archaeologists.</p>

<p>The deaths last mentioned extinguished, it is
said, the claim of legitimate Ptolemy heirs to the
Egyptian throne, but other writers assert that
this is probably a Roman invention to justify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
their ultimate seizure of the country and that
princes were living who would be recognized
elsewhere as legal successors. Be this as it may,
Ptolemy, familiarly known as Auletes (the flute
player), son of Lathyrus, with the bar sinister,
now came from Syria and assumed the crown,
under the title of Ptolemy XIII. (Neos Dionysus,
Philopater III, Philadelphus II), in 81
B. C. This was evidently with the consent of
the Egyptians themselves and the tacit permission
of Rome, to whom some even claim that
Alexander had willed his kingdom. The Senate,
however, did not give him official recognition,
though he made great efforts and offered many
bribes to secure it. A stele speaks of a high
priest “who placed the uræus crown on the
head of the new king of Egypt, on the day that
he took possession of Upper and Lower Egypt.
He landed at Memphis, he came into the temple
of Qe, with his nobles, his wives and his children.”</p>

<p>The sons of the Egyptian princess Silene also
came from Syria to Rome to assert a better right
to the Egyptian succession, but were unsuccessful.
The Romans engaged in other wars and
interests, for the time being, concerned themselves
little with the Egyptian question.</p>

<p>Tryphæna, Cleopatra V, possibly a sister of
the king, was his legal consort and his eldest
daughter, Berenike IV, was probably born 77
B. C. The last Cleopatra about 68 B. C., and
later another daughter, Arsinoe, and two sons.
Berenike was so much older than the other children
that some suppose a second marriage, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
which, however, no official record has been
found. The imputation of illegitimacy has been
thrown both on the king and his celebrated
daughter, but the Romans, as previously stated,
may, for their own purposes, have accepted or
disseminated the idea. The first Ptolemy had in a
sense wrested the country from its native rulers,
and his successors were only receiving in their
turn what they had meted out.</p>

<p>Like his predecessors, Ptolemy XIII built on
the temples, and there are pictures of him between
two goddesses in the favorite mode and in
other situations. In spite of this he is spoken of
as the “most idle and worthless of the Ptolemies.”
His life “idle, worthless, devoted to the orgies of
Dionysus (whence his title), and disgracing himself
by public competitions on the flute (whence
his nick-name), he has not a good word recorded
of him.” And Cicero says he was plaintive and
persuasive when in need, but worthless and
tyrannous when in power. The direct testimony
of Cicero and Diodorus Siculus (which we possess)
in regard to this period is of great value.</p>

<p>It was the debasing of the coinage that especially
caused the revolt that obliged Auletes to
flee the country, in addition to the fact that he
lent no help to his brother at Cyprus, overpowered
by the Romans. Auletes had assumed the
crown in 81 B. C., and kept possession for a
number of years, but a revolt of the Alexandrians,
for the reasons given above, forced him
to fly in 58 B. C.</p>

<p>When he was thus driven from the country
Cleopatra V, Tryphæna (whom some call his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
wife and some his eldest daughter), with the
spirit of that dominant race of women, at once
assumed the crown, of which, however, death deprived
her within the year. She was followed by
Berenike IV, possibly her daughter, certainly
that of Auletes, who ruled for two years, marrying
first Seleukos of the royal house of Syria
(whom she put away, finding him weak and unsatisfactory),
and substituted Archelaos, the high
priest of Komana. Seleukos is supposed to have
been the person who stole the golden coffin of
Alexander the Great and replaced it by a glass
one.</p>

<p>From subsequent events it is quite evident that
Berenike IV possessed the usual characteristics
of the Ptolemy women, both in capacity and ambition,
having no intention of handing back the
authority she had assumed to its previous possessor,
her father though he might be.</p>

<p>But Auletes, either by persuasion or bribery,
secured the powerful aid of the Romans, whom
Egypt was no longer strong enough to resist.
The Roman general Gabinius invaded Egypt and
conquering in the battle put the husband of Berenike
IV to death, restored Auletes and left him
to mete out further retribution as he would.</p>

<p>No pleadings for mercy, no claims of relationship
ever stayed the bloody hand of a Ptolemy
from executing his will, and, doubtless regarding
her as a traitor, Auletes put his daughter to death,
of which details are not given. There then remained
two daughters, Cleopatra and Arsinoe,
and two sons merely called Ptolemy. Restored
in 55 B. C. Ptolemy XIII only lived till 51 B. C. and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
died, bequeathing his kingdom jointly to his eldest
daughter and son and disregarding the fact
that he had virtually mortgaged it to the Romans
he adjured them to carry out his intentions,
calling all the gods to witness. A double
copy of his will was made, the one being sent
to Rome, the other kept in Alexandria.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_28">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT.<br />
<span class="smaller">CLEOPATRA VI.</span></h2>

<p>We have shown how the Persian rule in Egypt
was followed by that of the Ptolemies, and at
first the union between prince and people was
close and satisfactory. From Ptolemy I to Cleopatra
VI the rulers identified themselves with the
interests, and especially with the religion of the
nation, with whom they were not allied by blood,
built cities and temples and, the earlier members
of the dynasty at least, wrought for the general
good. In the case of most of the later kings,
however, they were more cruel and oppressive,
and revolts were more common than at first.</p>

<p>The architecture, especially the portrait sculpture
of the Ptolemy period, was inferior to some
of earlier date, but in the encouragement of literature,
the building of libraries and other public
edifices, and the extending of commerce the race
distinguished itself.</p>

<p>As regents or independent rulers their queens
held sway. The family intermarried to an extent
shocking to Christian ideas, and Ptolemy after
Ptolemy took his sister or other near relatives,
usually called Arsinoe, Berenike or Cleopatra, to
wife. These close relationships, however, did
not seem to strengthen the family affections—it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
is a blood-stained history, and the murders were
almost as numerous as the unions. Various towns
were built and called after the queens, Arsinoe
and Berenike, but though Cleopatra seems to have
been a favorite name, and there were, six or seven
of them in succession, this name was not so often
used as the cognomen of a town.</p>

<p>There are a few names in the world’s history
that stand alone. Many may share in the same,
but to speak them is to call up one dominating
image. In this sense there was but one Caesar,
but one Washington, but one Eve, but one Semiramis,
and to this class belongs Cleopatra. There
are others, such as Helen or Troy and Mary
Stuart, who have shared with these high reputation,
but in these cases further identification is
needed than the single name. Cleopatra stands
among the few daughters of Eve pre-eminent for
wit, charm, power and perhaps beauty, and to
this must be added ambition and vice.</p>

<p>“The laughing queen who held the world’s
great hands,” having won the heart of the world’s
greatest rulers, yet lays her magic touch upon
the centuries. Artists and writers have never
tired of limning her personal charms and special
characteristics. No colors have been too bright,
none too dark to be used. Shakespeare, has pictured
her with his immortal genius, and hundreds
of others, with more or less skill, have attempted
the same task. Protean in shape, no two perhaps
resemble each other. In the conception of
some, she is slender, graceful, exquisitely beautiful,
and at the other extreme, as in the old tapestry
in the New York Museum, she is like a fat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
Dutch woman, a decadence from Rubens’ overblown
beauties; so each land has pictured her according
to its own ideal.</p>

<p>Some have denied her pre-eminent beauty and
the conventional portrait of her which still exists
upon the wall at Denderah, as well as her face
upon the few battered coins of her time which
have come down to us, scarcely suggest it. But
the woman who made men her slaves at a single
interview surely lacked no charm that nature
could bestow. Unbridled both in passions and
ambitions, she knew no limit to either and grasped
at universal empire.</p>

<p>The greatest men of her time bowed at her
feet, and she changed the fate of battle with the
turning of her vessel’s prow. She was over
twenty when she captivated Caesar, over thirty
when Antony became her slave. Of her numerous
lovers, Antony was the chosen of that wayward,
passionate heart. She refused to survive
his defeat and death and perished by her own
hand. Though not, strictly speaking, Egyptian
queens, the Ptolemy race were yet queens of
Egypt—and thus ended the long line of female
royalties, extending from the dim ages of mythology
to the Roman period.</p>

<p>Cleopatra VI has been described by a late novelist,
his picture drawn perhaps from some historical
source, as having “a broad head, wavy
hair, deep-set eyes, full, eloquent mouth and a
long, slender throat.” Charm and talent of the
highest order are generally credited to her. She
had a musical voice and was a linguist of ability,
skilled in Greek and Latin and could converse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
with Ethiopians, Jews, Arabians, Syrians, Medes
and Persians and was proficient in music. Tennyson
says of her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Her warbling voice a lyre of wildest range,</div>
<div class="verse">Struck by all passions.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And another writer, disputing the fact that she
is sometimes depicted as swarthy, says she was
“a pure Macedonian of a race akin to and perhaps
fairer than the Greeks.”</p>

<p>Ptolemy XIII, the so-called Auletes, came to
the throne in a sense under the protection of the
Romans, and again took possession of the kingdom.
It was at this time that Antony first saw
Cleopatra, a girl of fifteen, and was struck with
her beauty, he being Master of Horse to the conquering
general, Gabrinus. But the acquaintance,
if such it was, and not merely a glimpse on Antony’s
part, went no further then, and neither
probably anticipated their subsequent relations.</p>

<p>Auletes’ will, demanding that his eldest son
and daughter should succeed him, was accepted
by the mixed populace of Alexandria, and in a
degree by the whole country, and for the moment
Rome did not interfere. It was a youthful pair
to have laid upon them or undertake such a grave
responsibility—a mere girl and a child. Cleopatra
was but sixteen, Ptolemy only ten. But
though young in years, Cleopatra soon showed
that she had both the capacity and ambition of
an older woman. The direct heritage perhaps
from one or other parent included beauty and
charm, but a worthless father had but little in the
way of character or mental abilities with which to
endow his children, and perhaps it was rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
from her mother that she derived her superior
characteristics. With such paternity and the traditions
of the entire race we can hardly wonder
at the instances of vice and cruelty which we find
recorded of this last royal member of her family.
That her story is so interwoven with Roman affairs
gives us a clearer knowledge of it than of
much of the previous history, which was included
only in that of Egypt and Syria.</p>

<p>So Cleopatra, a mere girl of sixteen or seventeen,
and her brother of ten, succeeded to the
throne and were accepted by the Alexandrians.
But the boy was persuaded by his counsellors to
oust his sister, who was forced to yield and fled
to Syria. That she had both adherents and means,
however, is proved by the fact that she did not
tamely submit to this violation of the agreement,
but promptly raised an army, and this alone seems
to indicate that, young as she was, she already
showed remarkable abilities and returned to recover
her lawful heritage. To live at peace with
each other seemed beyond the power of most of
the Ptolemy race.</p>

<p>At this point Pompey, seeking for allies, turned
toward Egypt, and the father of the young king
having been under obligations to him he made
overtures to the boy sovereign. But the party
in power, who for the time being were “the power
behind the throne,” decided to receive him with
apparent friendliness, and then treacherously
murdered him, hoping thereby to secure the more
powerful friendship of his adversary, Caesar.
Meanwhile the armies of the young king and his
sister lay opposite to each other. Caesar at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
once came to Egypt and was revolted at the
treacherous deed, but was not in a sufficiently
strong position to punish the murderers. He was
received somewhat coldly and had to proceed
with caution, but summoning his legions he remanded
that the youthful contestants for
the crown should appear before him and discuss
their claims peacefully, rather than by force of
arms.</p>

<p>This was Cleopatra’s opportunity; her strongest
weapons were her personal charms rather than
her military powers. At twenty years of age
she must have been in the perfect bloom of her
beauty, with exquisite eyes and coloring, the
sweetest of voices, a fascinating manner, ample
powers of wit and rare conversational abilities.
To these she trusted, and not in vain. Her position,
her very life was at stake; her adversaries,
who could probably hope for no consideration at
her hands should she again come into power,
would no doubt have been glad to assassinate
her had opportunity afforded. Fearing this, it is
said, and time seems to give credit to the story,
she hid herself in a bale of carpet and caused it to
be carried to Caesar’s palace by night. No device
which her fertile brain and keen wit could
invent, we may be sure, was lacking in the accessories
of the toilette to produce the effect she desired,
to move his pity and secure his assistance.
She played a great stake, perhaps with confidence,
perhaps with trembling of heart, but she won,
for from that time forward till his death Caesar,
elderly man though he was, between fifty and
sixty years of age, became her fervent admirer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Rarely, if ever, had woman accomplished so much
in a single interview. She must have been elated
with triumph and renewed confidence in her powers.
Yet Caesar did not attempt to make her
sole monarch; he lost his heart, so to speak, but
not his head, as Antony subsequently did. He
decreed that the will of Auletes should be carried
out, restored Cyprus to Egypt and proposed
that the younger brother and sister, Ptolemy and
Arsinoe, should be made its governors. He even
insisted that the money Cleopatra’s father had
pledged to Rome should be paid. For this purpose
it is said the young king’s plate was ostentatiously
pawned.</p>

<p>The king’s chief counsellor, Pothinos, not realizing
the strength that Caesar could command,
nor the personal ability of the man with whom he
had to deal, recalled the army and virtually declared
war. Cleopatra’s troops had either been
hired mercenaries, who deserted or whose time
had expired, and who went over to what they
considered the winning side, or they had been
defeated, for in this emergency she seems to have
been able to afford little support to Caesar. In
defending himself he set fire to the ships in the
harbor, and it is even reported that the great
library was burnt, but as various authors make
no mention of it this last disaster is questioned.</p>

<p>Caesar put to death the councillor, Pothinos,
and kept with him in the fortress his new love,
the beautiful Cleopatra, and the two boys, the
young king and his brother. The Princess Arsinoe,
probably also beautiful and attractive, and,
young as she was, realizing perhaps the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
and ambition of her elder sister, fled to the
Egyptian camp, thus refusing to put herself under
the protection of the conquering Roman, though
it was to him she owed her position as ruler of
Cyprus; but distrust was natural and perhaps not
unfounded. The Egyptians then demanded the
young king, and Caesar, though virtually master,
was not yet in a sufficiently strong position to refuse,
so, knowing that this mere boy could do
him no harm, he released him. It was, however,
but the poor youth’s death warrant, for in the
subsequent attack upon the Egyptians they were
driven into the river, and the royal boy came to
his end by drowning, saved by this possibly from
even a worse fate.</p>

<p>The Egyptians, disheartened, now gave up the
contest. Caesar treated them with comparative
leniency, set Cleopatra with the youngest Ptolemy
as her nominal husband over them and carried the
poor Princess Arsinoe to Rome, where, led in
chains, she was among the captives to grace the
triumph. She did not prove to have the power
of her sister’s fascinations to melt his hard heart.
Caesar may have considered that she was in debt
to him and had proved ungrateful and treacherous,
but this was an act unworthy of his character
and is attributed to the evil influence of Cleopatra.
There is no direct proof of this, though
his subsequent treatment of her sister gives color
to the idea.</p>

<p>After Caesar’s departure a child was born to
Cleopatra, whom she stated to be his son, gave
him the name of Caesarion, or some say the
name was given by the Alexandrians, and always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
upheld his royal prerogative even as against later
children of the more beloved Antony. These irregularities
and evil doings seem to have been
calmly accepted by the people, and in inscriptions
the boy is entitled, “Ptolemy, also Caesar,
the god Philopator Philometor.” He is to be
numbered among the young princes who came
to an untimely end; a brief life and a sad one, yet
it is possible, even probable, that it had its periods
of the pleasure and joy natural to his age, if no
prolonged happiness.</p>

<p>Some time between 48 and 44 B. C. Cleopatra
left Egypt with her brother and joined Caesar in
Rome. Probably he summoned her to come to
him, more probably it was of her own motion,
fearing that out of sight was out of mind, or
might prove so, and that her presence was necessary
to retain over him the influence she had
gained. It was a shameful connection, as Caesar
already had a wife, Caepurnia, and caused much
scandal, even in scandalous Rome. She is mentioned
by Cicero and others, but it is not her
beauty and her grace that he dwells upon, but
her haughtiness. Knowing full well probably
how she was regarded, she returned the latent
contempt which she divined in her visitor, even
if he did not make it apparent, with a proud and
supercilious demeanor. She had nothing to gain
from him and she did not seek to charm and
conciliate as she had done with Caesar. She
is, however, said to have promised him books
from the Alexandrian library, which seems to
suggest that there was some part of it yet remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
even if it had suffered damage by fire,
but failed to perform her promise.</p>

<p>Many of Caesar’s actions are credited to her
influence, and it is even believed that she desired
him to establish an empire with Alexandria rather
than Rome for its capital. The ostensible cause
of her visit to Rome was to negotiate a treaty
between the former and the country over which
she nominally ruled. She dwelt in Caesar’s palace
across the Tiber and held court, at which
not only Caesar’s adherents, but his opponents,
appeared, and it is said that statues of her, beautiful
probably as the Venus of Pauline Bonaparte,
were erected in the temple of the goddess of Love
and Beauty.</p>

<p>Yet this was no position of true dignity for
the nominal queen of a foreign land, and when
in 44 B. C. Caesar’s murder took from her his
support and protection she sailed for Egypt, no
broken-hearted mourner, but a woman still ambitious
and grasping all the possibilities of life.
The next year she disposed of her last incumbrance
and is held responsible for the murder of
her youngest and only surviving brother, the
nominal king. Four years each is the period assigned
to her joint rule with her two brothers.
She had no love to spare for her own kin, and
too evidently was glad to be rid of them, even if
the suspicion of her having poisoned the last of
her family, who appears to have died in the same
year as Caesar, may chance to be unfounded.</p>

<p>Now for a time Cleopatra bided at home,
waiting and watching for further opportunities
of conquests in love or dominion. Life with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
was devoted to self-seeking and pleasure, yet it
must have had some serious moments, some space
for display of maternal feeling, some days and
hours devoted to actual study; though it is hard
and unfamiliar to think of her in this aspect else
could she not have been mistress of so many
languages as are attributed to her. She, nominally
at least, governed the kingdom, cautiously
kept out of Roman entanglements and pleaded her
inability to assist the contestants with subsidies,
which, it is said, Cassius demanded from her on
the score of poverty. And indeed Egypt was in
no condition to be either a principal or an ally in
warfare at this time. The people suffered, the
queen probably still lived in luxury and abundance.</p>

<span class="smaller">CLEOPATRA VI (CONTINUED).</span></h2>

<p>Now again came Cleopatra’s opportunity. Antony,
victorious in the battle of Philippi, turned
his attention to the East, and summoned Cleopatra
before him, she being accused, as it has
been seen, perhaps untruly, of sending aid to his
rival, Cassius. Antony was of the party of
Caesar, had delivered his funeral oration and was
in a sense his successor. Like Caesar, also he
had a fair and devoted wife, the noble Fulvia, but
no legal bonds could resist “the Sorceress of the
Nile.”</p>

<p>Dellius, Antony’s messenger, at once foresaw
the probable result of a meeting between his
master and the fascinating Egyptian, advised her
to go in her “best style” and vaunted his chief as
the “gentlest and kindliest of soldiers.” But Cleopatra
was no subservient slave to hasten at the
first bidding, and, disregarding many summons,
took her own time and way to comply.</p>

<p>Her interview with Antony was in singular
contrast with her first meeting with Caesar. As
a fugitive and suppliant she conquered the one,
with regal pomp and magnificence the other. Perhaps
each method appealed most directly to the
man she had to deal with, and her keen perception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
indicated the different modes. Cæsar might
have shown himself less malleable to the dominant
queen, Antony to the pleading and powerless
maiden.</p>

<p>Josephus speaks of her corrupting Antony with
her “love trick,” and says he was bewitched and
utterly conquered by her charms—her “tricks”
were of large and magnificent description. She
made great preparations and gathered together
splendid ornaments and costly gifts. At last, with
full and well deserved confidence in her own
powers of fascination she started. Plutarch’s
words will best describe the gorgeous pageant she
devised. “She came sailing up the River Cydnus”
(Antony was in Cilicia) “in a barge with gilded
stem and outspread sails of purple, while oars of
silver beat time to the music of flutes and pipes
and harps. She herself lay all along under a
canopy of cloth of gold, dressed as Venus in a
picture, and beautiful young boys, like painted
Cupids, stood on each side to fan her. Her maids
were dressed like sea Nymphs and Graces, some
steered at the rudder, some working at the
ropes. The perfumes diffused themselves from
the vessel to the shore, which was covered with
multitudes.” The people vacated the whole place
and hastened to gaze upon the wondrous and
beautiful sight, while Antony remained alone,
awaiting the humble petitioner whom perhaps he
expected to appear before him. But finally as
Cleopatra intended he went to her.</p>

<p>“He found the preparations to receive him
magnificent beyond expression, but nothing so
admirable as the number of lights, for on a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
there was let down together so great a number
of branches with lights in them so ingeniously
disposed, some in squares, some in circles, that
the whole thing was a spectacle that has seldom
been equalled for beauty.”</p>

<p>This beginning was the keynote of their future
intercourse, amusements, banquets, entertainments
of all sorts. Cleopatra sent Antony the
whole gold service which he admired, and, according
to the familiar story, dissolved her pearl
earring in a cup of vinegar or sour wine, which
she made him drink. Pleasure was the goddess
whom they worshipped. Unworthy though it
might be of her fine powers and abilities, this was
perhaps the happiest time of Cleopatra’s life. Antony
tried to vie with her in the splendor of his
entertainments, but laughingly confessed she far
outdid him.</p>

<p>Something like true love for him seems to
have inspired the fickle queen. Caesar was but
three years dead, but he was unmourned and
forgotten. Antony was a handsome man of fine
and attractive appearance and is thus described:
“His beard was well grown, his forehead large
and his nose aquiline, giving him altogether a
bold, masculine look that reminded people of the
face of Hercules in painting and sculpture.”</p>

<p>He was of the type that is most apt to win
general regard generous and lavish, if not always
just or honest, free and easy in manner to his inferiors,
full of jokes and raillery and ready to
drink and gamble with almost any one. Physically
the two, the man and the woman, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
splendid specimens of the human race. Morally
what can be said of them?</p>

<p>Meanwhile Antony’s wife was fighting his battles
at Rome and beseeching him to return, which
he finally promised to do, but the Circe who held
him in thrall willed rather that he should go
with her to Alexandria, and prevailed, for he
basely yielded to her arguments and spent the
winter there, giving himself with her wholly up
to the pursuit of pleasure in every form and the
wildest revelry.</p>

<p>The inferior officers must have fulfilled their
duties more faithfully than their superiors or the
whole land would have been plunged in anarchy
and destruction. The laws were administered, industry
and commerce flourished, and Alexandria
continued to be a large, populous and busy city,
full of life and animation and adorned with many
magnificent buildings. The Pharos steadily cast
its beneficent light across the waters to be a
guide to mariners; the Temple of Serapis, on its
high platform, called attention to the worship of
the gods; the Library was as yet the casket of
valuable treasures; the Museum was thronged
with students and scholars; palaces and public
buildings adorned the beautiful streets, forts and
castles, breakwaters and harbor were laid out
and perfected and Alexandria was alone rivalled
by Rome.</p>

<p>The gods, too, no matter what might be the
moral aspect of the private life of royalty, were
worshipped and revered, and with the temples of
Denderah and Philæ the name of Cleopatra VI is
especially associated. Though less gigantic than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
some of the others, the Temple of Hathor, the
Goddess of Love, at Denderah, with that at Philae
were none the less beautiful. Here at Dendera
or Denderah, the Tentyra of the Greeks, a yearly
festival was conducted with great splendor. The
original edifice dated back to the earliest period
of Egyptian history; it was added to and altered
by the monarchs of the Twelfth Dynasty, by
Thothmes III and by Rameses II and III. It is
said to have contained no less than twelve crypts.
On the site of this old building the later Ptolemies
had re-erected a newer structure, and it is
here, on the southern, rear wall was found the
conventional portrait of Cleopatra VI, as Isis,
and her son Caesarion.</p>

<p>The exquisite beauty of the ruins at Philae
still charm the beholder—graceful columns and
feathery palms, like cameos against the radiant
blue of the sky, the river softly lapping at their
feet. We can imagine the splendor and magnificence
of it all, when in the completeness of its
perfection and the queenly Venus with her attendant
train of followers, adding its artistic and
picturesque human element to the scene.</p>

<p>Thus in gaiety and revel the Roman soldier,
forgetful of his duties, and his fair enchantress,
passed the time. Says Plutarch further of Cleopatra:
“Plato admits four sorts of flattery, but
she had a thousand. Were Antony serious or
disposed to mirth she had at any moment some
new delight or charm to meet his wishes; at every
turn she was upon him, drank with him, hunted
with him, and when he exercised in arms she
was there to see. At night she would go rambling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
with him to disturb and torment people at
their doors and windows, dressed like a servant
woman, for Anthony also went in servant’s disguise.”
But it is further added that “the Alexandrians
in general all liked it well enough and
joined good humoredly and kindly in his frolic
and play, saying they were much obliged to Antony
for acting the tragic parts at Rome and
keeping his comedy for them.”</p>

<p>The story of the fishing party is among the
more innocent of these frolics. Antony, not having
good luck, secretly caused divers to put fishes
upon his hook, which Cleopatra discovering, got
beforehand with him and had a salted, dried fish
put on, which of course caused much amusement
and merriment when drawn to the surface,
and “the laughing queen” is reported to have
said, “Leave the fishing, General, to us poor sovereigns
of Pharos and Canopus; your game is
cities, kingdoms and provinces!”</p>

<p>But the blackest stain upon this period is the
murder of the poor princess, Arsinoe, who had
taken refuge at Miletus, in the temple of Artemis
Leucophryne, and who was put to death there by
Antony’s orders, at the instigation of Cleopatra.
Perhaps beautiful and attractive also, if to a less
extent, how different were the experiences of the
two sisters! It seems strange that Arsinoe was
not already the wife of and under the protection
of some powerful noble or king—but Fate decreed
differently.</p>

<p>Their mad existence could not continue forever
and matters at Rome grew so serious for
Antony that he finally tore himself away from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
enchantress and returned. His wife came to
meet him, but died on the journey, so that legally
he was now a free man. One almost wonders
that he did not marry Cleopatra and try to make
himself king of Egypt, as the first Ptolemy had
done. But probably his reason forbade the attempt,
and old relations once more began to hold
sway. He made peace with the new Caesar, Octavian,
Julius’ nephew, and accepted his offer of
his half-sister, Octavia, the recent widow of
Caius Marcellus, for his wife, the Senate dispensing
with the law which obliged a widow to pay
the respect of ten months of single life to her late
husband. Octavia was a fine and beautiful woman,
and is spoken of as serious and gentle, worthy
of a better fate than to be the mate of Antony.
For a time, however, she won his regard and an
influence for good over him, recalling him to his
better self, and a return to public duties, till Antony
undertook the campaign against Parthion,
and came once more within reach of his former
enslaver.</p>

<p>For four years he seems to have been separated
from Cleopatra, who had borne him twins, and
with strange patience bided her time. She is said
to have maintained the claims of her eldest son
Caesarion and during all this time to have made
no demands on Antony. He had left her, spite
of all she had done, or could do, to detain him,
and wounded, mortified and indignant, perhaps,
she held her peace.</p>

<p>Pride is sometimes as strong a motive as love
itself. So far solace she turned, as so many before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
her had done, to the building and repairing
of temples.</p>

<p>Ebers has assumed in the preface to his “Cleopatra”
that the colossal pair, hand in hand, found
at Alexandria in 1892, of which the female figure
is fairly preserved, represent Antony and
Cleopatra. Once within reach of her, Antony’s
old passion revived, and he sent for her to Syria.
Very differently she acted from the first time he
had summoned her; she needed no second bidding,
but came at his call, and all was as before
between them. He made her numerous and valuable
gifts, acknowledged the twins as his own,
giving them the names of Alexander and Cleopatra,
and as surnames the titles of “Sun” and
“Moon,” and utterly broke loose from all his obligations.
Once more Cleopatra triumphed.</p>

<p>She then returned to Egypt, while Antony went
further afield; she in the interval going in state
to Jerusalem, to visit Herod the Great. Says
another writer in “The Greek World Under
Roman Sway:” “The scene at Herod’s palace
must have been inimitable. The display of counter
fascinations between the two tigers, their voluptuous
natures mutually attracted, their hatred
giving to each the deep interest in the other which
so often turns to mutual passion while it incites
to conquest, the grace and finish of their manners,
concealing a ruthless ferocity, the splendor
of their appointments—what more dramatic picture
can we imagine in history?”</p>

<p>But in this instance Cleopatra did not make
the usual conquest, though she doubtless exerted
all her powers. Although (under unjust accusation)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
he was eventually persuaded to put her to
death, Herod was at that time passionately attached
to his wife, Mariamme, and withstood
Cleopatra’s fascinations. The reunion of Antony
and Cleopatra was most alarming to him,
and he even consulted his council as to whether
she, being in his power, he might dare to make
away with her, but the dread of Antony’s vengeance
prevented, and with much polite attention
and many gifts, she was escorted back to Egypt.</p>

<p>Antony’s campaign against Parthia was a failure,
but as before two women stood ready to assist
him. Cleopatra on the one hand, accused of
having violated tombs and robbed temples, perhaps
for this very purpose, hastened to Syria to
meet him, with provisions and clothing for his
distressed army, while on the other Octavia came
to Athens with even larger supplies. But as
against Fulvia, so now, Cleopatra was victor, and
Antony accompanied her to Alexandria. Again
he gave himself up to his mad infatuation, incensing
the Romans (who regarded Cleopatra
with horror and aversion) at every step.</p>

<p>Plutarch gives us a graphic picture: “Assembling
the people in the exercise grounds and causing
two golden thrones to be placed on a platform
of silver, the one for him, the other for
Cleopatra, and at their feet lower down for their
children, he proclaimed Cleopatra Queen of
Egypt, Cyprus, Libya and Coele-Syria, and with
her co-jointly Caesarion, the reported son of the
former Caesar. His own sons by Cleopatra (she
bore him two sons and a daughter) were to
have the style of ‘king of kings;’ to Alexander he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
gave Armenia and Media, with Parthia, so soon
as it should be overcome; to Ptolemy, Phœnicia,
Syria and Cilicia. Alexander was brought before
the people in Median costume, the tiara and
upright peak, and Ptolemy in boots and mantle
and Macedonian cap, done about with the diadem,
for this was the habit of the successors of Alexander,
as the other was of the Medes and Armenians.
As soon as they had saluted their parents
the one was received by a guard of Macedonians,
the other by one of Armenians.” Cleopatra
was then, as at other times when she appeared
in public, dressed in the habit of the goddess
Isis.</p>

<p>These theatrical performances were doubtless
entertaining to the people, who, in all countries,
love public shows, as well to the principals who
never seemed to tire of their masquerading and
lulled to rest complaints and dissatisfaction, with
the existing order of things. For now Antony
and Cleopatra proceeded to Athens to enact similar
scenes. The people there were said to be attached
to and to have paid great regard to Octavia,
and Cleopatra claimed the like honors.</p>

<p>But the folly of Antony’s course was raising
against him a powerful faction, and Cæsar Octavian
did everything to augment this feeling and
prepared for war. Cleopatra now put all the resources
of her kingdom at Antony’s command
and insisted on accompanying him to battle, herself
in charge of the Egyptian fleet. They went
to Samos and to Actium, where Antony gathered
together his army and it is said would have
fought on land, but Cleopatra insisted that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
strength of the rivals should be tested at sea.
One dominant thought possessed her, as strong,
or stronger, than her love for Antony—it was
an invincible dread of being taken captive by and
made to grace the triumph of the brother of the
outraged Octavia. At sea she might hope to escape
as she could not on land. It was this doubtless,
more than cowardice, for however wicked
she certainly was a brave woman and not lacking
in physical courage, that made her at the
first evidence that the battle was going against
Antony, turn her vessel’s prow and seek safety
in flight.</p>

<p>Losing heart and head at once Antony blindly
followed. For years Cleopatra had been his inspiration,
his passion, his lode-star; where else
to fly he knew not, his old world was, all too
deservedly, against him. Yet it was not now
for joyance that he sought, though he followed
her; he steeled his heart against her sorceries,
and shut himself up in morbid communings with
his own spirit. He would not see her and for
some time it was in vain that her maidens pleaded
with and tried to comfort him.</p>

<p>It seemed for the moment as if Cleopatra’s
power, she who “governed men by change” had
failed. Her heart cried out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Where is Mark Antony?</div>
<div class="verse">The man my lover with whom I rode sublime</div>
<div class="verse">On Fortune’s neck; we sat as god by god;</div>
<div class="verse">The Nilus would have risen before his time,</div>
<div class="verse">And flooded at our nod.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But a reconciliation finally ensued. Not to
be at peace with Cleopatra was to give up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
last hope, and apparently his only chance for a
renewal of life and power. His army, deserted
by its officers, made submission to Cæsar, who
thus remained complete victor.</p>

<p>Arrived in Africa, Cleopatra proceeded to
Alexandria, while Antony remained alone, wandering
about in comparative solitude, with only
one of two friends. Reaching home, the queen
pretended to have conquered rather than been
defeated, and proceeded to put to death people,
official and otherwise, of whom she wished to
be rid. Not for one moment does she seem to
have sat down and given up to despair, as did
Antony. One project after another was entered
upon and put in execution, and when Antony,
weary of wandering, at last joined her again, he
found her busy endeavoring to have her fleet
dragged across the Isthmus of Suez, from the
Mediterranean to the Red Sea, that she might
escape to the other side and find a place of
refuge and safety. But the Arabians burnt her
ships and she was forced to abandon her gigantic
scheme. She also sent embassies to Cæsar,
praying that she might be allowed to retain
Egypt for herself and her children and that
Antony might dwell there or in Athens as a private
individual. Cæsar professed to be willing
to grant her anything that was reasonable, but
was inexorable as regards Antony. If she
would murder Antony, get him out of the way
by whatever means, then her own prospects would
be better.</p>

<p>But wicked, ambitious, and cruel as Cleopatra
undoubtedly was, the most sincere sentiment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
her wayward life seems her attachment to Antony.
To this she clung, preferring to share
his fate—even death itself, than abandon or kill
him. Nevertheless Antony was jealous and suspicious
of her, and once more shut himself up
in moody solitude. That her star had set, the
knell of her doom sounded, Cleopatra must have
clearly foreseen, but to the very end she held her
head proudly and showed unbroken spirit. Not
for her in modern parlance was “the white
feather.” Once more and for the last time she
tempted Antony to her side. It must have been
impossible for him to withhold his meed of admiration
from this undaunted soul. Once more
it was for them both, “Let us eat and drink for
to-morrow we die!” and they plunged into the
same revelry, almost on the brink, as it were, of
the grave. For them life had held little that was
better, but the fine flavor of earlier times must
have departed and there could not but be bitterness
in their souls as they partook of their
“dead sea fruit.”</p>

<p>Cleopatra now completed her tomb, which, like
so many Egyptian monarchs, she had begun before;
in which she gathered together all her treasures
and made strange experiments, with various
poisons, on her unfortunate slaves, seeking to
know how death might be most easily attained.
While inexorable fate in the person of the world
conqueror, Octavius Cæsar, moved steadily and
surely towards the besotted pair, Cleopatra
<em>would</em> not put herself in the power of the conqueror,
she <em>would</em> not grace his triumph. Rather
than that welcome death!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>Cæsar on his part was most anxious to possess
himself of her valuables and to prevent her
from killing herself, as he feared she might do,
and continued to send her plausible messages,
but she did not trust him. He had taken Pelusium
and now advanced to invest Alexandria.
The toils were tightening around the tiger queen,
like the iron tower which enshrouded the prisoner
and daily grew smaller, so misfortune closed in
upon her. She deserved her fate, she had even
done much to provoke it, but one cannot withhold
some pity and admiration from the dauntless,
if wicked, woman.</p>

<p>Antony plucked up his spirit and made one
successful sally against the surrounding host, but
it was but the dying flicker of the candle; defeat
followed, and his fleet and troops deserted to the
conqueror. He accused Cleopatra of treachery,
rushing through the streets and decrying her
aloud in his mad fury. She fled and shut herself
up with her maidens and attendants in her
well guarded tomb, while Antony retired to his
palace. She then caused word to be sent to him
that she had committed suicide, and a wave of
tenderness overwhelmed him, while he lauded
her bravery and begged his attendant to kill him,
but the faithful servant only thrust his sword into
his own body, and fell dead at his master’s feet.
In despair Antony wounded himself, but not at
once fatally, and word being brought him that
Cleopatra still lived, he demanded and entreated
to be carried to her.</p>

<p>Fearful of Cæsar’s emissaries, she refused to
unbar the great stone door, but she and her maidens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
drew her dying lover up to the balcony, exerting
all their strength, and laid his on a bed,
where he expired in her arms.</p>

<p>Like a requiem mournfully seems to float in
fragmentary cadence,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I am dying, Egypt, dying,</div>
<div class="verse">Ebbs the crimson life tide fast,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Then she gave herself up to a passionate grief,
of which we cannot doubt the sincerity, children—country—<em>all</em>
was forgotten in her wild outburst
of sorrow, and still the pitiful story drew
to its close. Cleopatra attempted suicide, but
Cæsar’s messengers having now reached the upper
story, with scaling ladders, arrived in time
to prevent, and drew her dagger away, even
threatening her with the destruction of all her
children if she did not desist. Now for a space
she changed her policy, but probably never her
mind, which was evidently bent on self-destruction.
She arrayed herself in fine garments and
received Cæsar, delivering over to him, nominally,
all her treasures, but flying into a furious passion
with a servant who betrayed that she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
withholding a part; alternate gusts of fury and
grief swayed the now enfeebled and broken body,
and the tormented soul. At one instant she drew
herself up in queenly dignity, at another threw
herself at Cæsar’s feet, bathed in tears. He
raised and tried to reassure her, pretending that
he intended her no harm, but never relinquishing
the fixed purpose of having her grace his
triumph. While she, on her part, allowing herself
to seem comforted, was equally unchanged in
her determination. ’Tis said that during this interview
Octavius kept his eyes upon the ground
that neither the sight of her beauty nor her grief
might move him.</p>

<p>And now comes the last act of the theatrical
and tragic story. A basket of figs was sent up
to the queen, and hidden in that, or in the apartment,
was the asp, the messenger of death.
Crowned and arrayed as for a festival she laid
herself upon the bed where Antony had expired,
and received a bite from the irritated snake,
which she had tormented to his fatal task, she
breathed her last. The passionate devotion she
had inspired was proven by the self-destruction
of her two maidens, Iras and Charmian, both of
whom followed her example. Many old stories
have been, by modern criticism and research,
proved to be mythical tales, but this seems to hold
its own. She had written a pitiful entreaty to
Cæsar that she might be buried in the same tomb
with Antony, the last proof that her love for him
was indeed a true affection. No sooner had Octavius
received this than he suspected her design,
and again sent his messengers, if possible, to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
it. But they were too late, and we close
with Plutarch’s words: “Iras, one of her women,
lay dying at her feet and Charmian, just ready
to fall, scarce able to hold up her head, was adjusting
her mistress’ diadem.” The picture is
very touching. “And,” continues the narrative,
“when one that came in said, ‘Was this well done
of your lady, Charmian?’ ‘Perfectly well,’ she
answered, ‘and as became the daughter of so
many kings.’ And as she said this she fell dead
by the bedside.”</p>

<p>Thus the curtain was rung down on the last
act of the tragedy. Though faded in bloom, and
torn with emotions the still beautiful queen, in all
the statuesque majesty of death, lay upon her
couch, while as in life her faithful maidens bore
her company. So expired the last and most
noted queen of Egypt and Rome, long virtually
master, took full possession. Balked in his
scheme of carrying Cleopatra captive, Cæsar
showed what his fixed determination had been by
having a golden statue of her made, with the asp
upon her arm, and carried in his triumphal procession.</p>

<p>Of the fate of Cleopatra’s children, history
makes brief mention. The young Cæsarion,
whose rights his mother had always so carefully
guarded, had been sent away with his tutor to the
town of far Berenike, but the faithless man betrayed
him to Octavian, who had both him and
Antony’s son, Antyllus, who had been declared an
hereditary prince, cruelly murdered. The
younger children, though they soon pass from
the records and are lost to sight, had perchance a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
happier fate. The young princess Cleopatra, Antony’s
daughter, who doubtless possessed at least
a portion of her mother’s beauty, was married to
Juba, the so-called “literary king” of Mauritania,
and Octavian, having removed those members of
the family that he considered in any way dangerous
to his own autocratic authority, permitted the
sister to carry with her the two younger brothers,
Alexander and Ptolemy, and thus the once
mighty kingdom of Egypt lay prostrate under the
foot of the temporary master of the world and
became a Roman province; and the history of the
Ptolemy race virtually ends with that of the
world renowned queen, as Tennyson says, “a name
forever.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
